I began writing these reminders in 1997,

In pursuit of my own daily inner heaven;

Thank you for all sharing them has given. 

Birthday / Milestone / Anniversary?

Give them the gift of synchronicity:

Scan the qr or visit https://Daryl.Be

This book holds 1,440 messages, each offering another way to think or feel about whatever may be on your mind at that moment. The writings take the voice of a trusted friend, of your most positive yet pertinent self-talk. This volume is part of the ever-expanding series by Daryl Browne, an author who has committed several hours each day over the past 25 years to writing messages that speak from and for the journey through one's own thoughts and feelings. What he continues to discover and share in his work is that sometimes you have to go everywhere else before you stop and realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be.

Between arriving and when you've left

Makes a journey of about 1,000 breaths.

Take a reminder to come breathe again.



Before you go, be still a moment. Pause.

Help yourself to some food for thought:

Pick a scroll, one last little pinch of salt.

-->
</head>
<body>
<pre>
Inhale. Exhale. This is one breath...

In for your heart, out for your head,

Openly inviting what comes next...



Each of these is from some moment I lived

By greeting what that moment came with.

Let each remind you that You are the gift.



Foreword --

<span id="title"></span>

---

Epigraph --

<span id="subtitle"></span>

---

Prologue --

I dedicate this whole book to You -

Not for what you've been through -

But for all You have yet to choose.

---

Preface --

I believe everything happens for a reason.

I believe everywhere we go, we're needed.

I believe everyone we meet will teach us.

---

Introduction --

If every moment has something to say,

Doesn't each minute of any given day?

The present is yours to open, either way.



Once you've arrived, wherever you go,

Treat this like your momentary home.

Care for everything here as your own.



Some of your deeds are already legendary.

Some consider you like a living sanctuary.

Yes, you are currently that extraordinary.



Reflect on that. What did you discover?

It may be difficult to explain to another.

Treasure what you feel, yet cannot utter.



Remember to carve out daily time

To relax, reset, renew, and unwind

Into a deeper, higher peace of mind.



Once you control how you behave,

You control your own mind frame.

Even reversed, it works the same.



From this hour's beginning to end -

One journey of one thousand breaths

Can lay one thousand worries to rest.



Though few have your level of clarity,

It just became that much less of a rarity

Because of your unmistakable sincerity.



You stopped your inner dizziness,

By halting all the outer busyness:

Outwardly still, inwardly curious.



For one moment, focus on breathing.

When you feel that inner grip easing,

Bring home this lightness of feeling.



You came here and left the world behind.

So be gradual when restarting your mind,

Telling it to be gentle, loving, and kind.



Kudos for coming, for being fully here.

Even more than keeping everything clear,

You expanded your own innermost frontier.



Your presence has been a gift from today's grace

That's added more goodness to this special space.

May you keep feeling the world's silent embrace.



Know it or not, You are the Gift.

So your simply being here uplifts.

You've already made things shift.



You were wise to set aside other stuff,

In doing so, proving you do not bluff:

You're wise to know You Are Enough.



Inhale, then exhale - for one breath.

Into your heart, out from your head

Is how to face whatever comes next.



Congratulations on taking these clear breaths,

On laying the unclear and unnecessary to rest,

And recognizing how you are so clearly blessed.



Think about the space in your chest,

About each one of your open breaths:

Each one gets deeper when you do less.



Pushing forward, you'll get pulled back,

Because there is a gravity that attracts.

Pull harder. Break orbit. That is that.



No, your opposition isn't any smarter.

Yes, work hard, but yes, think harder.

Thinking ahead is like wearing armor.



Going without is going to break you apart

Which then helps the transformation start

Which then reconnects you to your heart.



You may not have all the proper support,

But the reason you will never fall short

Is because you are willing to transform.



You may go off on many a daring expedition.

You may stay right here, but lost in wishing.

You transform through basic daily decisions.



Facing this fear is the one that transforms,

The one that forever destroys your norms.

No matter what, keep on moving towards.



Traveling far doesn't mean you've arrived

Any more than breathing means you're alive.

Challenge the unspoken reasons you strive.



What was once the hardest part is now done.

But soon even greater victories will be won.

You are about to meet your inner champion.



Fitness can serve as your best medicine

To keep any negativity from getting in

And keep you focused on how you'll win.



Enough thought about what you'll begin!

The day to imagine's the day you are in.

It is the proven habit that's the win.



If acting out is still within you,

There is more growing left to do.

You are on the way to your truth.



There is no place you need to be going,

Nothing critical for you to be knowing.

This is simply what it is to be growing.



This is not done, but you need to get going,

Toward people who you need to be showing

So this gets more nourishment for growing.



After the plan, the feeling will remain -

Because it's about much more than gain:

Growth is in your heart, not your brain.



The quality of what comes in is essential

Because of how it grows your potential and

How it can make that growth exponential.



Regardless of what needs you the most,

Life is not about some duty you hold -

It is going to have to be about growth.



It can be frustrating to be in need,

But just imagine how an infant feels

And trust that growth is guaranteed.



You have chopped down that rotted tree -

The leaning decay of all limiting beliefs,

So newer growth can branch out freely.



Growth is set to happen no matter what.

You just have to be willing to shed stuff

And sprout new powers on your way up.



Some mistakes can stifle your growth,

So be humble in your overall approach

Even about things you think you know.



Kindness will heal you from within when

You touch wherever your blockage begins.

Illness versus love? The heart will win.



In the past, you sacrificed your health,

Which forced you to try something else.

What did it take then to heal yourself?



You are one magnificent creature

With so many incredible features.

What are your healing procedures?



Give yourself a little more time to recover.

You've taken a break? Maybe take another.

You yourself are your own healing's usher.



You recuperate by listening to feelings

Despite the cures that sound appealing

To go on your own journey of healing.



You have an advantage you're not revealing -

That certain habits simply aren't appealing.

Use this as you head into deeper healing.



Thoughts come from, and turn into feelings.

So the situation with which you're dealing

Can help you think your way into healing.



Just like a rope, your patience can fray

If twisted and pulled every which way; 

Mend it by giving yourself a quiet day.



Are you open to letting life take control?

Are you willing to wait for things to unfold?

Are you able to feel what your future holds?



There is nothing for you to prove.

There is no one choice to choose -

There is no one left to be but You.



There is nothing you need to cut loose.

There is no solution for you to deduce.

There are only paths for you to choose.



Given the insight you now know to use,

Each of your senses can also help choose

The way that holds your greatest truths.



Choose a little bit more consciously

So that whatever you may be deciding

Matches up with some deeper belief.



No matter who tries to get you to move,

You have to stick to your own values.

All you have is your power to choose.



Today, rather than bothering to analyze,

Just keep on loving what happens inside

And choose the deepening over the rise.



You are doing what your past wanted to do,

But did you originally, consciously choose?

Today pick a path that is in some way new.



Choose that least certain opportunity,

Since it's the only vantage point worthy

Of showing you who you're waiting to be.



Truly, sometimes some things choose you

Because you are either ready or willing to

Welcome whatever they blossom you into.



All this effort you are prepared to use

Should instead go to help you to choose

Which of your stories it's time to lose.



The words you use are the most deciding

Of what you will be feeling and inviting,

So use words you yourself find exciting.



Imagine you just finished everything -

Feel all the ease that that would bring:

Change what happens next by imagining.



When mulling over which path to choose,

Make peace with what you intended to do;

Build upon what already comes from you.



Some things are simply here to refuse -

To remind you you should always choose

Bare feet rather than too-tight shoes. 



Stepping outside everyone else's rules,

Your sincerest and clearest way, choose.

Decide, using your own highest values.



Less-perfect versions will show up first

Making you think the right one is worse;

Choose the one that deepens your thirst.



Since you're open to better possibilities

Others will come bearing more of these;

Choose the option that comes with keys.



It's not enough to know - you need tools

To shape things into a form you can use;

How else do you build what you choose?



Take that road - what is there to lose?

If anything, it will help you to choose

Since it is better to try than to refuse.



Choose the path that honors You,

Not where you are or what you do,

But how you are, and for now, who.



Part of you feels it would seem rude

And part yearns to unleash your mood;

Step away from both before you choose.



You can take more time to enjoy this.

Relaxation isn't relaxing in little bits.

Live a life in which far less doing fits.



We're only as good as our ability to detach,

So when life and your vision are a mismatch,

Relaxation is the itch you need to scratch.



When worried, go visit your state of mind,

And ask what it needs to relax and unwind.

This tends to improve things in no time.



Do this from a state that is relaxed

- from a state less addicted to facts;

Welcome what detachment attracts.



You must consciously make time to relax.

Unplug all connection. Forgo more facts.

You gain ground when you just sit down.



Consider things that are immense -

Do they work best when most tense?

Relaxing is all that makes sense.



Things work out, you already know that.

It doesn't mean you should just sit back.

But it does mean you can certainly relax.



More than ever, you need organization

To tuck away any and all complication

As you devote time to deep relaxation.



Once you are no longer on the attack,

The answers come as soon as you relax

And imagine strong winds at your back.



Where there is nervousness there is what?

What can those doubts help you dream of?

Nothing. Relax and dream of what you love. 



Doesn't have to be fought, fixed or forced -

There is a reason. This thing has a source.

Relax and you'll see and say, "Of course!"



There's nothing for you back there anymore.

So instead use this time to relax and restore,

Because today has for you adventures galore.



When you finish resting, are you still tired?

Have you gotten the amount that you desire?

Are you getting the kind of rest you require?



Surrender to rest, don't push it around.

Once it overtakes you, give in, lay down.

When it says hush, don't make a sound.



If fortunate enough to do what you love,

Then blessed enough to uplift everyone,

And wise enough to stop and rest some.



Out loud or not, you've heard it before:

"Why can't you do just a little bit more?"

Answer, "That's not what I'm here for."



The same way the sun daily sets,

Get away and create time to rest. 

This is the way to be your best.



You underestimate your need for rest,

Your need to melt in a loving caress.

Your need to feel ease in your chest.



To get rid of the stress,

Clean your mind's mess

Through genuine rest.



Believe they're doing their very best

Without adding the pressure of a test;

Trust in the flow and get better rest.



Know good from bad kinds of stress.

Give in to mayhem or give in to rest.

Lay down weary and rise up the best.



Certain memories that still feel like loss

Are not at all about you paying life's cost,

They feel like this to keep your heart soft.



What you will gain will be worth the loss

Despite the deep emptiness it will cause:

To meet you, love has to first go across.



You gain the most through your loss,

So allow the pain to make you pause.

You still have a distance to cross.



Whatever you feel as if you have lost,

Reached a bridge it was time to cross.

Thank you for paying the toll's cost.



Spend due time with the sorrow;

Spend the present, never borrow

- Joy rightfully owns tomorrow.



It can be healthy to speak to your sorrow,

But in the wrong group, you'll just wallow:

Share only where "Growth!" is their motto.



Be sad for as long as you must and move on.

You don't need to be ready, or even strong.

Just find a nearby path you can walk along.



And if it had happened in any other way

You would not have this awareness today;

Gather your regrets and throw them away.



Recognizing is very different from regret:

Recognizing creates a whole new mindset.

Recognizing the past helps what's not yet.



Pain is allowed. Let it flow right by.

Bear witness with a compassionate eye,

Remembering that trust makes it subside.



The most important part to remember

About going or being on an adventure

Is to go deeper, you have to surrender.



Most of this is out of your control,

So remember to let go of your role

Because you are both young and old.



Remember, and stop forgetting

That it's never about perfecting

But only ever about connecting.



You are allowed to grieve and sit awhile

But listen closely for the voice inside.

When it says to return, do so in style.



When underneath the shade tree of grief,

Set yourself down and get a little sleep.

You will awaken to the light of peace.



Yes, appreciate all the beautiful things!

But also notice what the ordinary brings.

Are you the song or the one who sings?



Appreciating is now your most useful skill:

It makes what seemed empty somehow fill,

And what you couldn't do, what you will.



You've no idea how hard this could be.

And why should you? There is no need.

Appreciate what has arrived effortlessly.



Whether it is destined to be small or grand,

Expectation turns enjoyment into a demand:

Appreciation makes what seems good expand.



Once you dream, want and eventually have it

Enough times, you can get locked into habit:

Appreciate, but ultimately drop this baggage.



The chance to strive is always available.

But how long is your striving bearable?

Your self-appreciation is unassailable.



Appreciate windows, acknowledge doors.

Use time better than you ever have before.

Be as clear as you can - not one bit more.



Let your mind loose on this one.

Tell it to be creative, to have fun.

Then appreciate what it gets done.



Perfecting your skills will never be enough.

Grow your abilities to appreciate and love,

And you'll be someone no one ever tires of.



The time you take to notice and appreciate

May inconvenience or even make you late.

But gratitude is what turns good to great.



Appreciation speaks with more than words

From all who witnessed your brave return.

Congratulations from all who've observed.



Just tell all of them to wait,

Just let yourself arrive late,

Just be here and appreciate.



Love in a big way - give what seems small:

Remind everyone you appreciate them all.

Thanks to you, many more will stand tall.



This time allow the passage of some time

Before interrupting with logic and mind.

Step back and appreciate this grapevine.



Appreciate every one of your cravings:

How they can instigate some misbehaving,

Yet thanklessly handle daily lifesaving.



Appreciate ordeals that feel harder still,

When the intended goals go unfulfilled,

When all you truly are and own is Will.



If you catch yourself correcting another

Stop yourself from speaking any further

Until you can appreciate what you heard.



Appreciate and you'll never go hungry;

Once you behold any bit of it as lovely,

Somehow you start feeling just bubbly.



You've been busy collecting experiences

Appreciating them with all your senses;

Now it is time that you just share them.



Instead of wondering about the other side

And gathering knowledge that feeds pride,

Why not appreciate your own lovely stride?



When your mind wishes to retaliate,

This is the perfect time to negotiate

And ask it to first let you appreciate.



Dive into a deep moment of thought

To appreciate everything you've got

And be grateful for what you're not.



Can you finally forget about the how?

To synchronicity can you finally bow?

Open and observe, appreciate and allow.



That door is unlocked by these two keys:

Do you appreciate this self you perceive?

Do you feel you can both give and receive?



Instead of considering yourself uneven,

Notice the changing in your reasons:

Appreciate all your internal seasons.



You need to make time to celebrate

With ones who can truly appreciate

What in this makes you feel great.



Do you appreciate all of your emotions?

Even the ones that roar like the ocean?

Even the ones that ask not to be spoken?



Let this remind you - You are the treasure,

With a way of being that's beyond measure.

Who you are puts everything else together.



Thank you for being as conscious as you are,

For shining with the light of a guiding star.

You continue to be the greatest gift by far.



Appreciated more than you could ever know,

Because you help everyone around you grow,

You are the gift - your life is a loving glow.



Dearest Beloved, this can no longer wait

Or simply be left to the timing of fate:

You are the gift - the process of great.



You are the gift, so welcome this thought

Because it could, would, should and ought

To be something that occurs to you a lot.



Your glow just continues to increase,

Yet even without this radiant reach -

You are the gift - already, complete.



Whether or not you needed a little lift,

Or something to name your latest shift,

Let this remind you: You are the gift.



Regardless of where your mind is at,

Or whether you recall this one fact:

You are a true gift, and that is that.



When you're in your own space,

What you begin to feel is grace

Within this moment's embrace.



Which are you thinking about right now?

Who, what, when, where, or maybe how?

Which thoughts deserve thinking about?



What are you most focused on today?

And what if this doesn't go your way?

Can you see goodness within a delay?



What are you wondering, right this moment?

Are these your own thoughts you've chosen?

Are all your intentions out here in the open?



You're still asking for reasons why?

What if you left that search behind?

What if all you did next was to try?



What are you assuming will always be here?

Things always change - is this not yet clear?

Why not put some focus on a new frontier?



Are you sure that your thinking is correct?

Have you actually taken the time to reflect?

If not, what else needs to be double-checked?



Does what you are thinking serve you today?

Or is it another small step leading you astray?

Which thoughts are ready to be thrown away?



Are there any undesirable patterns

In what you think and then do after?

For you yourself - what truly matters?



How are you using today's given time?

What feels wasted - what feels wise?

Where will you never compromise?



Did one issue all of a sudden become two?

Have they multiplied? Could that be true?

Which one matters - if you had to choose?



If you focused first on what you love most,

How would today begin? How would it go?

Would you even need to have any control?



Are these the best thoughts you can think?

Can you allow all the negative ones to sink?

Can you take yourself to the positive brink?



The things that bother your mind the most -

Are they things over which you have control?

What about the entire inner world you own?



Is there another way to think about this?

A way that in your heart feels like a fit?

A way that puts you in the middle of it?



How would it be to ignore everyone's chatter?

What would you need for no result to matter?

Who could you be if you broke one pattern?



What is the story that runs on its own?

That makes you feel like it's in control?

What is the story that is going to go?



If you feel you know who you are exactly,

You're thinking, and too matter-of-factly.

Fall in love with your unknowns - madly.



What do you love most? What do you least?

What do you lack? What could be increased?

Have you heard it said, "Enough is a feast?"



What makes you feel the exact way you feel?

Is it something situations themselves reveal?

Or are you the one who creates what's real?



"To thine own self be true."

If this is not an easy thing to do,

To whom do you have what to prove?



When do you feel put to the test?

When are you outdone by stress?

When do you perform at your best?



Is there something you need to ask yourself?

Is there a story you need to hear You tell?

Is there something you know all too well?



Are you looking at all this realistically?

Or are you seeing it as you need it to be?

Either way, are you doing so consciously?



Are you hearing just what you want to hear?

Or do you try to make your listening clear?

Don't both ends of this have to be sincere?



Is your initial intention still here?

Do you honor it or just keep it near?

Could it redefine what you hold dear?



Do you laugh from the belly or the chest?

Do you forget about whatever comes next?

Do you remember where you feel blessed?



Onto your approach, does it make sense?

Which part of it is feeling odd or dense?

How could you feel light, yet immense?



Look again at how things are laid out;

Do they reflect what you're all about?

Are you investing your ideal amount?



Be mindful of what you tend to produce;

Does it put your goodness to good use?

Does it let even more creativity loose?



What do you find yourself doing today?

As you build, is this a solid brick to lay?

Should you be spending more time this way?



What is it you do to make them furious?

Aren't you more than just a bit curious?

Are they rightly concerned or delirious?



Let others choose what they will follow.

For you those options would feel hollow.

Which one makes your heart shout bravo?



What sort of role do you have to wear?

Are you expected to have a certain air?

Is it something you give proper care?



What lifts your feet up off of the floor?

When does joy well up from your core?

How could you enjoy this even more?



Above all, are you enjoying yourself?

Does this thing improve your health?

What else will matter but how you felt?



How are you doing with your life script?

Have you been keeping up with writing it?

Is it a story that you have the best role in?



What are the words you unthinkingly use

When trying to push yourself to choose?

Which are the words it is time to lose?



What question is content with one reply?

What question does not somehow multiply?

What question are you willing to let die?



Still thinking about it as all or none?

Is there a place between boring and fun?

Is there a way to get this gently done?



It should be big! Why make it small?

If you can leap, why choose to crawl?

Since you're able, why not give it all?



Are you getting yourself roped in again?

Is this another "and then... and then..."?

Can you get some advice from an old friend?



And why did you need to go over there?

Why did you believe you needed repair?

Can you flow with flaws and not care?



Have you ever been wrong before?

Then ended up finding out more?

Isn't it patience that opens doors?



When do you feel secure and safe?

Is it at the very end of your day?

Or the moment it gets underway?



Can you accept the importance of your name?

Without it, does your work breathe the same?

With it, how much trust will be ingrained?



Do you understand what they're about,

Before you follow them on their route?

Do they put more in or want more out?



Does it fit your set of priorities?

Does it deepen your sense of curiosity?

Does it enrich your life's quality?



What can you do right now?

What can you do - and how?

What in you already abounds?



How long will it take to build?

Who all has the required skills?

What vision will this fulfill?



Is it the root of the problem you seek?

Why not instead find where it is weak?

What dam outlasts its own worst leak?



How much do you identify with your name?

As for your stories, are you doing the same?

Do these even begin to describe your range?



Are you doing this to get something done?

Does what you're up to have an outcome?

Do you know how to do just for fun?



What thought could bring you relief?

Why not think this rather than seek?

As you do, is there any goal to meet?



Who here stays busy simply keeping track?

Who here is giving to get something back?

Who does your present personality attract?



Can you wiggle your toes in imaginary sand?

Or daydream gardens where butterflies land?

Can you move through today without a plan?



Was that the point - to achieve and excel?

Is it to give so much you sacrifice yourself?

Is that any kind of way for you to be well?



Was that last journey too hard to repeat?

Would you rather find a comfortable seat?

Or are you ready to get back on your feet?



Do flowers only grow if there's a fence?

Does light shine through what is dense?

What is the point to being this intense?



Before you march to the beat of their drum,

Do you know where they are coming from?

Would you join all of them, or only some?



Does kindness strive to dominate?

Does fairness move to manipulate?

Does simplicity try to complicate?



When were you last completely quiet?

When did you last attempt to try it?

When will you go on a word diet?



You're expected to want something more,

And so what is all that wanting ever for?

Does it point to a place that feels pure?



Have you realized more about love?

Have you felt what you are made of?

Have you come to realize you are enough?



What does love mean to you now?

Has this changed, and if so, how?

Is it what to fight for... or allow?



As you train to become beyond compare,

Are you honestly able to say, "I failed,"

Knowing each try is as vital as fresh air?



Doesn't it keep you in this spot?

Doesn't it ask of you quite a lot?

What would happen if you forgot?



What if your best habits hold you back?

What if you can travel without a track?

What if you don't even need to pack?



Who do you know who's wiser than you?

Are they a part of your social group?

If not, how can you make this true?



What was the point of this adventure?

Was it ever to pile up more treasure?

Wasn't it to put the pieces together?



What if you didn't have to be consistent?

What if rules were actually non-existent?

What if you only cared about this instant?



Your hard work can become its own addiction

That is only satisfied when you feel friction:

Could gracefulness become your life mission?



You were lied to, and now know the truth:

Could that discovery create someone new?

Could it ever? Or is that part up to you?



How much rest do you get by oversleeping?

Or how is tea that spends too long steeping?

If you can give, why even think of keeping?



Do you get the importance of being clear?

Is your message simple as well as sincere?

Is it something that you should also hear?



Is this the time and place to share?

Are you surrounded by those who care?

By people already awake and aware?



The same ones who keep asking you to wait

Are the ones for whom you never hesitate.

Do you need to rethink how you navigate?



Are you leaving space to let things go?

Can you let the empty space in you grow?

Can there be truth in what you don't know?



What matters - that you have understanding?

Or that you allow, without being demanding?

Are you fully open to what life is handing?



You keep standing in your own way

By hiding behind your own r&#0233;sum&#0233;.

Can you throw the qualifications away?



Do you do the same thing over and over?

And has it made you any faster or slower?

Most importantly: do you feel any closer?



Life goes as it goes, not as planned.

This is not a request - it is a demand:

You get back up. Do you understand?



Is your position supposed to stay the same

Despite how the conditions have changed?

How can you adapt, adjust and rearrange?



Can you imagine an infinite light?

One that gives you infinite sight?

Didn't you just turn it on inside?



Is it actual or just appeal?

Is it truly something real?

How supported do you feel?



How deep inside your precious home

Do you let someone you don't know?

It might be time to ask them to go.



If there's no training left to work toward,

If you throw all those steps out the door,

Then you're already here, needing no more.



Are you happy knowing or happier on the go?

Are you the ice on top or the stream below?

Each one is water, but does each have flow?



Are you just delivering another deliverable?

Or are you climbing toward some pinnacle?

Do you know your own guiding principle?



Do you wonder why you do certain things?

Are you happy with what their results bring?

Could you be more aware before and during?



Do you wonder why you get the same results?

Do you identify with awareness or impulse?

Are you closer to your inner child or adult?



If you thought of yourself as much more,

As someone more important than ever before,

Then would it be easier for you to be sure?



Would you like to feel amazing all the time?

Do you know what effects your state of mind?

Are your actions and your interests aligned?



Who in you hears without a word spoken?

Who has keys to the doors you want opened?

Are you the one who decides what's chosen?



Are you speaking in defense?

Do you need to be so intense?

Does this make complete sense?



Do you realize you're still telling a story?

Even though having one is not mandatory?

Why do you still have it in your inventory?



How do you feel about being right here?

About being this far along, yet unclear?

Could you make this feeling disappear?



When things go poorly, how do you cope?

How long do you allow yourself to mope?

What thought always fills you with hope?



What was once - but is no longer - upsetting?

Congratulations on forgiving and forgetting.

Abundance comes next (without expecting).



A feeling you've been through this before

Is far from something you should ignore -

Why don't you knock on a different door?



Do you realize pursuing comfort gets old?

Do you realize part of you craves a new goal?

Do you realize most of you is still unknown?



Is there another way to think about yourself?

One that has a broader definition of wealth?

One that has a deeper definition of health?



Worrying about what you can't control

Overlooks the mindset you actually own

That can conquer as well as it can console.



Do you know the way? Are you sure?

What if you get sidetracked or detoured?

What are you willing to endure?



Do you want the destination or the journey?

Can you dig up gems without getting dirty?

How do you show Time that you're worthy?



Do others have their own plans for you?

Do those plans feel anything like truth?

Does your heart know what to pursue?



What wars do you unquestioningly take on?

When do you disregard right versus wrong?

How can you live from here all day long?



Are you sure this is what you truly want?

That your passion is far from nonchalant?

That you'd give all the strength you've got?



Waiting for someone to be your guide?

Remember all the things you've tried?

Aware of the wisdom you hold inside?



Are you working from an inner vision?

Do you care about anyone else's opinion?

Are you going to make your own decision?



Are you filtering out all the noise?

Are you considering everyone's voice?

Will they feel included in your choice?



Have you learned as much from the mistakes

As when things have simply gone your way?

Will you keep trying more, whatever it takes?



Who can you think of who is farther along?

Who, where you feel weak, is already strong?

Who has experience that you can build upon?



When did you just know you knew it all?

Was it just before or after a rise or a fall?

Keep that ego not too big, not too small.



You have a brain, but do you know the kind?

Do you feel better if you make up your mind?

Or better being free to change it all the time?



Are you expecting there to be some formula?

Success, by definition, goes to the abnormal.

Aren't you glad you're still unconformable?



Can you believe there's still a long way to go?

Can you believe you have a lot more to grow?

Can you believe there's nothing else to know?



Are you enjoying the journey as you go?

Do you feel like there's still more to know?

What will you do when you reach a plateau?



What are you most grateful for in your life?

What things would you rather leave behind?

Which of these opposites grows your mind?



Where are you when all this stuff happens?

Does your mind take you to way back then?

What better place can you vividly imagine?



Does it feel like you've reached the point

Past which you'll be far beyond annoyed?

Is the answer in the one thing you avoid?



They're speaking from fear, is that right?

Is that a good reason to become uptight?

Is it so easy for them to dim your light?



If the way you give wears you down,

Turn your idea of generosity around:

Give yourself more than you've allowed.



If thinking of staying makes you hesitant,

Then relocate to somewhere more pleasant

By feeling it first and planning it second.



Have you heard it's from what you focus on?

Does that explanation fit here or feel wrong?

What's possible if you continue right along?



Close the books filled with old stories,

Because not even the very best of these

Can top your own unfolding mysteries.



Clarity needs ample room to see true, so

Stay unattached from all points of view.

Free of a plan you will know what to do.



Healing arrives hand-in-hand with calm

To listen to whatever they called "wrong"

And through tenderness keep you strong.



Things get better - that is what they do.

As wishes can change, so habits can too.

It all starts with you, undeniably, You.



As you grow the faith to rise up and out,

You also outgrow status, pomp and clout;

Something amazing is starting to sprout.



Smile about where you find yourself now.

Give all due credit to your own know-how

With one great big, self-celebrating bow.



Who's around you reflects what's within.

So look to the Chooser before you begin

To judge anyone - friend, enemy, or kin.



All you can improve is your own attitude

So beware of feeling consumed by a mood

Lest you become that one emotion's food.



There's always a way to recognize lack -

Just a habit on which to turn your back

By leading your focus to positive facts.



Keep your heart flame burning brightest.

Though others ask you to tend to the rest

Stoke what brings warmth to your chest.



Time always reveals more, so just wait.

Have a lifetime view; you can't be late.

You see turns, but the way is straight.



Notice the souls you give the most time -

Do they offer goodness of body and mind?

Are they your example of how to be kind?



Insist on loving no matter what happens.

Turn away from "I'll love only when..."

Heart survives even its own time's end.



If you can choose to be kind or be right,

Choose to be One who prefers to be nice

And yields lovingly by remaining light.



This may be the time for you to be brave

And stand for yourself and others today.

Be here rooted in truth, come what may.



There is a world far beyond being liked,

Where you uncover more than you might

Once you put their opinions out of sight.



It may take all you have to get back up.

Know this is not a should - it is a must:

Rise again with renewed love and trust.



Bypass roads that run shrouded in dark,

That twist round corners or seem stark.

Head toward the light, guided by heart.



Know when you've had exactly enough.

Maintain yourself with focus and love.

Parent your desires: be firm, not rough.



It is time to come out from your shell

Where things are ready to go very well

And give you incredible stories to tell.



Asking yourself is a most powerful skill

That takes as much honesty as pure will.

Ask again and again without an "until."



Forget about limits - forget about clout,

Forget about all of that word-of-mouth. 

Forget about thinking. Be here and now.



The words themselves are nearly useless.

How they're delivered is the truest test.

Forgo what's said to hear what's meant.



Today brightens or dims your tomorrows

Depending on if you sacrifice or borrow,

So one-by-one resolve all your quarrels.



Make action certain. Make action swift.

Make the kind of decision that is quick.

Nimble non-attachment has its benefits.



Consider as much as possible beforehand,

But when it's time, simply do all you can,

Not what you don't quite yet understand.



Require positivity of yourself. Insist.

Invites to fume or fuss or feud, resist.

Speak brightly as light piercing mist.



Who cares if others have failed before?

Such talk takes time you cannot afford,

Because the work itself is your reward.



Keep seeking flow as your way of being.

Always go deeper past what you're seeing

To what is most captivating yet freeing.



What you are doing is considered pursuit

Of what you have greatest attachment to.

Without your chasing, would it find you?



It's good to acknowledge areas of limit.

It shows you are willing to yield within

With flexible grace - a tree in the wind.



Don't say you can't - say that you don't.

Though you surely can, you simply won't.

Practice this until it is fully your own.



Who thus far has been the strongest force?

Who would you call your greatest source?

Who when you ask always says of course?



Lumping these all together is incorrect.

To split those up could be to disrespect.

So weigh what your decision will affect.



Thinking you know, you may deeply err.

Only through feeling can you get there.

Head will assume but heart rarely dares.



Stillness will come if you just continue

To do everything that you are most into,

And be open to finding a favorite venue.



Be true to your word for its own sake do

Because new worlds unfold for people who

Decide, then proclaim and then execute.



Wait before calling circumstance unfair.

Instead find the opportunity to be aware

Of what needs work, and precisely where.



Wanting it all is a part of being human;

But you will only be truly wealthy when

You let the strings of attachment loosen.



Stay outside of it a few moments longer.

This will make your perspective stronger

And help your imagination do its ponder.



It hurts the worst yet blooms brightest,

Wherever failure has drained you driest;

Soak in this rain and grow your highest.



Looking at the effort you've exerted,

Has this made you even more certain?

Do you see another door you can open?



Sometimes, you'll do best to disappear -

Put yourself where you are nowhere near

Influences that would cause you to veer.



Being good to yourself can mean to stop.

Let all the tasks and appointments drop.

Raise your busy hands and let them flop.



You are still doing more than you might

Were something else to hold you alight.

Do a bit less. It will all be just right.



To understand, try to breathe like them.

How air moves can tell you what's meant

And can even tell what they'll say next.



Let go of all the emotional belongings,

Reminiscences, grudges and old longings

They're too much for you to be hauling.



Belief is a perfect substitute for knowing

Since it makes sure interest keeps growing

Until you find your own seeds for sowing.



You do not have to accept what you see.

And may even do better to rely on belief

Until this seed looks more like a tree.



Being spontaneous you outrun resistance,

Gain momentum and surround opposition.

Surprise them all - defy every condition.



Stop talking to those who fuss and rage,

Rattling against their own imagined cage.

Nurture a peace that surpasses your age.



Interrupt whoever drudges up history.

Politely redirect talk of dark mystery.

Mind all that travels conversationally.



There is no need for defense or retreat

Once you decide to be unmoved by defeat

And choose to become impossible to beat.



Until you can move on, keep your spirit

By being mindful of who you let near it.

Among noisy folk will you even hear it?



The one who's asking, "Oh, but what if?"

Would be better off just looking within

To see there is only from here to begin. 



With words, speak caringly and sparingly

And use other means to convey unerringly

Whatever needs to be expressed unwarily.



Stop wondering what anyone else thinks.

In your plan that will make some kinks.

Opinion gets stale and then it stinks.



Waiting can serve as a precious aspect

In pursuing a goal and looking ahead.

Anticipation can be energy well spent.



Health extends from a healthier center.

Tender areas - use tenderness to enter.

So be gentler on yourself, far gentler.



Be polite with your faults - be polite.

No "How long until they turn right?"

Realize they obey only loving insight.



Rough self-motivation is just as rude as

A teacher shouting the lesson in school.

Loving-kindness is more powerful fuel.



Hold your tongue as you would a feather;

Your ears and words are closely tethered

And turn the world when used together.



Your body tells you it has had enough.

There is little point remaining rough.

A master is flexible - not just tough.



Your body has spoken, so do not delay.

It keeps telling you in its gentlest way

That what is within can no longer stay.



What if you have nothing left to earn -

No new next offers over which to churn?

You're richest when you forget to yearn.



Your mind's job is to fish for reasons,

To deliver a why, no matter the season.

To refuse to accept any isn't treason.



Going forward takes more than spending,

It takes humility and true heart rending.

Even in life, the soul can be ascending.



Become bored by villains, plots and twists

That busy your mind yet all wisdom miss;

Lovingly trust where each one's role fits.



Expectation can stifle joy. Be mindful.

Explanation can go unending. Be final.

Everything but love can go. Be primal.



When you need to ingrain better patterns

To maintain focus on what truly matters,

Light the way with love as your lantern.



Keep leading your mind back from there

Because of what awaits it's not yet aware.

New benefits are to be found elsewhere.



Listen closest to what is sitting silent.

Clues that were never openly expressed

Point directly into what's truly meant.



Which part of you will you let choose -

The one that usually gets you to refuse,

Or the one that always finds your muse?



How it feels makes all the difference

As your choices make the most sense

When conviction drives your intent.



The value comes from what you don't get.

Endless options remain within "not yet,"

Which means no goal is ever truly unmet.



You are gathering allies as you go along

And sometimes the mix will feel wrong.

Difficult partnerships make you strong.



The long or short way through your desert,

Whichever seems easier mirages your effort;

Whichever way dares you will prove better.



Replace what worries with what's light.

Get plenty of sleep and dream at night. 

Wake up to goals that grant new sight.



This is just what becoming looks like -

No longer back there, nor fully in sight

Peeling back layer upon layer of mights.



How necessary each and every mistake is:

Flawless for triggering learning within.

Bow to lessons that come from each miss.



Some search for themselves by using you.

While yet an honor, it has nothing to do

With your purpose or what you're up to.



Turning back to find the way is silly.

It is not warm back there, it's chilly.

Turn to the sun as if you were a lily.



When wants can just be, you've arrived.

Most never challenge the voices inside

That are a shallow part of being alive.



Whatever unravels you again and again

Is just asking life's toughest question:

Whatever you want, can you first lend?



Giving up the old welcomes in the new.

Now to figure out what to give the boot:

It's for the practice, anything will do.



Drop should-haves, maybes and oughts;

Lead your mind toward its best thoughts.

Show it what body and soul have brought.



There is a time to be wary of extremes,

Of mosts and bests, without in-betweens.

Neither glut nor starve: find your lean.



Trust the hints that you are receiving.

Though words and acts can be deceiving,

Your body grants the truth of feeling.



You first summon your power by deciding.

When you do the work, you're fortifying.

Again and now your power is multiplying.



And sometimes it takes one huge push,

A grueling effort, a send-off, a whoosh,

If your Will were a sled dog, a "Mush!"



You will know when you have tried hard,

When effort relieves you of your guard,

And nothing you've ever done is on par.



There is another self inside You

Who would love to be invited to

Show off talents you never knew.



Tranquility is something all your own -

Something that lives within your bones,

Something that in your posture shows.



Stop all that unconsciously apologizing,

Yielding time-space without recognizing

Mindless retreat keeps you from rising.



You've outgrown fitting in with anyone,

Heedlessly brilliant as the noonday sun.

Just being yourself you warm everyone.



Acting on impulses will humble you when

You are asked to deliver the words again,

Forced to replay what you barely meant.



Be as interested in giving as in getting

Because it is as important to be letting

Others enjoy the pleasure of begetting.



Whether as a member or out on your own,

See that your truth always stands alone,

And the mirror reflects one well-known.



Being whole by yourself is impossible -

The world has awaited you most of all -

Both you and your gift are inseparable.



Be whole first. Become a part afterward.

First you find your own inner wonderful,

Then you help unveiling the same in all.



Be with it. No matter how hard it is.

Don't turn away. You dive directly in.

If it hurts, hurt. Hold up your chin.



The feelings will go and you will stay.

So be with what you know to be underway

And allow everything, including a delay.



Remain right here and see for yourself:

You don't need anything to enjoy health;

Just as you are, you define being well.



To keep the crowds out of your garden,

Post up signs, implore visitors' pardon

To not step where you've worked hardest.



Mend your fence and latch up your gate.

When the need comes it may be too late.

Boundaries are nothing to leave to fate.



There is so much to have gratitude for.

When you begin, there'll be even more.

Thanks opens for you a spiritual door.



You need to refuse what they're offering.

It is not time for you to be broadening.

You need to be deepening and softening.



There is something to be said for focus.

It trains us to set up our own locus of

Sharp thought so nothing can yolk us.



They may know more than you do today.

Best to silence inner backtalk and wait

To hear everything they have to say.



You might know more than they do today.

So keep quiet a moment more and refrain

From doing as told or believing hearsay.



Move your dream forward one step today.

Come up with some half hour-long foray.

Confidence grows from little hoorays.



Your certainty makes you more effective.

It convinces them you have perspective,

And then renders your charisma electric.



Life is long. You have time. Calm down.

Wake up. Open your eyes. Look around.

Wiggle your toes deep into this ground.



Try another approach and see the results

But whatever your theory, don't give up.

You're farther than you had dreamed of.



You can regroup, retrain and rebound by

Leaving those who prefer to trend down.

Upward again might mean turning around.



You are wise to turn from some journeys,

To roll up those maps and sound retreat,

When just pressing on is just unhealthy.



No "figuring out" or "working through."

Just pause right here, where within you

Flows power you've barely begun to use.



Say goodbye to unchosen feelings.

Free of them, no longer kneeling,

You are sheer lightness of being.



The reasons are rarely as loud as news,

But latest events are not of much use.

Stick with clear thoughts as your tools.



Today is your invitation to shed layers,

To be rid of charlatans and soothsayers,

To start over with a new set of prayers.



Are you sure this you knows what's best?

Have you eaten properly and gotten rest?

Are all your senses sharpened and fresh?



Speak too soon and you may rouse a riot.

All the better if you can covertly try it;

Keep your goal warm, close and quiet.



Try pleasant, flexible and eager today,

And if blocked, creatively another way.

Get your chosen results, come what may.



Be true and truth won't be hard to find.

Be forgiving and everyone will be kind.

Be brave and you will unlock your mind.



The error of judging them is behind you,

Mastering forgiveness and starting anew.

This time around, let opinions be few.



Treasure this living wisdom you hold,

And trust that it does not fully unroll

Until you go and face your unknowns.



If they feel more comfortable shouting,

Or blaming others or even just pouting,

Quietly escape: take an internal outing.



Emotional routines carve unmeant masks

That others copy to make their own cast.

How you choose to feel spreads and lasts.



This is all you need: make the decision.

Don't be too attached to fine precision.

Trust the accuracy of your inner vision.



Trust your gut - your wordless instinct,

Your sage giving teachings most succinct.

Thanks be to the way that you're linked.



Give your likes and dislikes equal say.

Take no sides until things are underway.

Whichever asks more of you, by it stay.



Surroundings influence all your beliefs.

Surroundings tell your eyes what to see.

Choose your own surroundings carefully.



So do the right thing at the right time.

To the trigger let your reaction rhyme,

And best of all if it can be oh so kind.



Indeed, timing makes all the difference.

Act too early and instead erect a fence.

Too late and the action makes no sense.



Your friends are mirrors to well behold,

All of them copies of the self you mold.

What does each of your reflections show?



And now get ready to outdo yourself -

Precedents are there to surpass or else

You risk sitting your power on a shelf.



Now are you ready to let go of the rest?

To redefine what it means to be blessed?

To be what you've given, not possessed?



Whatever you cling to should go out next

To put your comfort zone to the test and

See with or without, you remain blessed.



Dislike means you still require clarity

And self-forgiveness to accurately see

That everyone makes up your "Me."



Discover more by observing yourselves -

How each reacts when someone delves

Deeper than what each normally tells.



Successful your every chosen endeavor,

Provided you prepare for daily weather,

And just as often, expect to do better.



Time now to decide what you want to see

Of the world and who you're ready to be

Because you have enough to do anything.



Be right here where your power resides,

Drifting to nor fro despite rising tides,

Floating on the tranquility deep inside.



Faithfully follow your plan for the day.

At the same time, bend with life's sway.

If asked to, unquestioningly give way.



You embody what is precious about life,

So drop here now, any remnant of strife.

In this, your enlightenment has arrived.



Know you are living your life perfectly.

You have overcome what no one will see

To become this example of manifesting.



Today brings another treasure trove more

Of uncanny, precious coincidences galore

Delivered right to your schedule's door.



Be as deaf ears to their negative words.

Mind your manners as you inwardly turn.

Save hearing for what helps to be heard.



Use patient ears to hear negative words.

Someone is trying to convey their hurt.

Open heart, toward love and light turn.



You must be done with correcting others;

Passion breathes but correcting smothers

Via revisions the sentiment of Another.



Neither fact nor opinion lives eternally

So why should you feel anything but ease?

Take a breath and enjoy the witnessing.



You did what fit for then. This is now.

Past is just a When. Focus on your How.

Give all you did before a farewell bow.



Do activities that build up your being.

When not busy, find yourself practicing.

Potency is in simple acts of preparing.



Can you recognize what makes you whole?

When with others, do you feed your soul?

Will you discover truth past being told?



The day is meant for little investments,

Small, key decisions, subtle sentiments.

Where you are going's a half step ahead.



Today runs on what was possible before.

From here your options increase tenfold

Provided you let the future stay untold.



Freedom and access - these are worth it.

The ability to step on in and be certain

That each option is pursuable and open.



Your intentions are supposed to change

As experience gives you a wider range.

Revisit what you want again and again.



Masters of details are junk collectors.

Pupils of perspective are the investors,

The ones to search out as your mentors.



Escape your own rules. Run free. Go far.

Faster, take flight. Find your lucky star!

See? Its shine just reflects who you are.



You can be disinterested yet discerning,

Serenely detached while deeply learning,

Bearing witness to the endless churning.



You can figure this out - You are ready.

Aim with sharpened sight holding steady.

Target what's hiding behind what's petty.



Go face the source of all this confusion,

Through each of its fine veils of illusion

And bring this chapter to its conclusion.



Choose a fitting attitude. You're ready.

Focus on your feeling. Don't turn heady.

It will work out, even what seems petty.



Attitudes reflect you the same as clothes:

Too big or small and people will suppose

You don't check yourself from top to toes.



Wear attitudes that express your heart.

No need to put on what will fall apart.

Just as you are, you are a work of art.



What you give freely always makes more.

It's the magic little spell by which your

Release triggers endless deeper stores.



There will always be new places to go,

To taste or to touch or to see or know.

Life is long, so make your process slow.



Climb the higher ground toward your goal

By sacrificing today what's comfortable.

Self-discipline is worth itself in gold.



A sense of purpose will keep you healthy

And if it does not also make you wealthy

The reward's just nearby being stealthy.



Have you made a list yet?

That is a dream's best bet

To get you in its mindset.



How you do today is what matters most.

Be lively, do not haunt it like a ghost.

As guest, see the day as gracious host.



You are a waking aspect of your dreams,

Using what sleep gave you effortlessly,

So enjoy this part with masterful ease.



Expectations are weeds - clip them back.

Garden well, and what threatens, attack.

Uproot each and every sprout of a lack.



You will find stillness outlasts skill.

Hiking mindfully beats dashing uphill,

And serenity is a better ally than will.



Grace beats effort so, work on your flow.

Shift from doing only what you can show.

Become the spirit that harmony bestows.



Cherish your life in day-sized servings.

Weeks, months and years are all unworthy

Of focus because they're ever-diverging.



Experience yourself not just the events.

Lest you find built round you some fence

Edging you outside of your own presence.



What nourishes you changes all the time.

Have to be listening to hear the rhyme -

The belly's verse followed by the mind's.



Body's needs first, heart's desire next.

In this order, you'll only feel blessed

Whenever love has for stamina a test.



Untangle from your stories - be set free.

What is behind you is a disproven theory

About who is here now and has yet to be.



Make Levity and Lightness your friends.

A life lived with laughter knows no end;

Its tales retold rebirth laughter again.



Spread allies out, around on each side.

You never know when you'll be surprised

And need someone else to turn your tide.



When the time to fight comes, be quick.

Swiftness can make you uneasily tricked

And ensure that to your plan they stick.



Key is to focus on just one front, else

Jeopardize the whole point of the hunt.

Relentlessly chase what it is you want.



Leave familiar territory far behind,

The mission in front, your allies beside,

And be in the center - lead from inside.



Allow negativity to exhaust itself out -

To hoot, holler, fuss or scramble about.

True positivity has no message to shout.



Limits and delays are mostly dreamed up

Because who knows the right schedule of

A plan that has been created with love?



Refuse to judge it, and it will move on.

Stay where you are. Be consciously calm.

You be the landmark that you base upon.



Savor times between wanting and getting.

They're when you see what you're letting

Jam up your present by never forgetting.



Forgiving transforms you, it truly does.

It rewrites your past in phrases of love

And ensures the future will rise above.



To feel obligated is to ignore yourself,

Lose your time and squander all wealth.

Choose all you do: this creates health.



Obligation should make your skin crawl.

Duty will build around you a high wall.

Instead let your mindset be charitable.



When thrown off course, orient yourself.

Do an assessment of your overall health.

Keep track daily of what you last felt.



Make small shifts with intense patience.

Search until you find the ideal occasion

To alter yourself, your finest creation.



Time to look at your current direction

Side-by-side with your life momentum

So you'll recognize useful connections.



If you can see confusion up ahead, turn.

Chaos leads one way - straight to a burn.

Closer to harmony, it's easier to learn.



This is all to peel away your eggshell,

To shed your before as enough and well

And to convince you a new story to tell.



Too many work hard; too few work smart.

Savvy ends where the strong back starts so

Conserve your power and use other parts.



No one lies to anyone before themselves.

Whether it is from you or someone else,

Deception points back to a heart unwell.



This is but one way to see things. Tilt

To notice how your perspective's filled

With details that only matter until...



Health isn't an investment; it's a way.

Forget tomorrow's benefits - notice today

How a bit of exercise helps your brain.



Step outside of it, and walk its edges.

Get to where you can see how precious

It all is - even the tiny imperfections.



There is no point in forever responding.

To hear yourself should get you yawning.

You're the sun - it is time for dawning.



Be mindful because your thoughts attract

Vibrations that always reverberate back

To key people who are vague or exact.



Everything has proof of your potential,

Whether spiritual, physical, or mental.

Anything you think or sense is tenable.



Are the rules necessary, or convenient?

Do they cheer you on or watch, silent?

Can you tell which ones are irrelevant?



The heart doesn't have nearsightedness.

When you use it to see you'll find this,

That they haven't found their way yet.



Words tangle the truth, so please simplify.

Remove any and all that might jeopardize

The plain and clear brevity of being wise.



Accept apologies with very special care,

Boldly delivered only by those who dare

To forgive their ego's not being aware.



Difficulty is neither friend nor enemy,

But that from which you choose to see

Each violent wave or one peaceful sea.



Dream before dawn and do before dusk,

This is the life you've chosen and must

Honor what elders in you did entrust.



Give up social norms for personal depth.

Deviate from all those regimented steps.

Your destiny is an unpaved path ahead.



Do things that build, bridge or blossom.

Check in with everybody often, being a

Living example of all you taught them.



You will need to claim your own space,

So get away from those whose words raid 

Your ideas before their base is laid.



Reasons only seem deeply important. It's

Really how much feeling you afford them.

Your whys bloom as much you adore them.



Sleep waits at the other end of strength,

To prove you have done your best when

At day's end you crave nothing but rest.



You are the source of truth you seek, no

Additional corners around which to peek.

The mind just full of training is weak.



Rise - it is now the time for you to rise,

To face the master you already are inside,

And see yourself from behind your eyes.



Rise in relation to where you have been.

That was fine then, but not once again.

It is never too late or soon to begin.



There are no one-size-fits-all methods.

You must be listening to all your senses.

Each says what another didn't mention.



It is only about what is true for you,

With no one to whom you owe any proof.

You are on a path that is totally new.



See this from that other point of view.

It's not absurd, it's simply new to you.

If you were them you would do it too.



The brain will overspend its attention.

You should stay focused on the lesson.

Patience is worth more than intention.



Body needs mind as mind needs heart.

You are less useful without every part,

Like canvas by itself trying to be art.



Feel and then think; think and then do,

In this order and you'll follow through.

To bloom, you need an emotional root.



You bear as much as you can surmount - 

More of a feeling than measurable amount

So gauge by your heart, not a headcount.



What provokes you is what improves you,

Just as waves make jagged rocks smooth.

The trick is for you to simply not move.



This is when you need to be impatient,

To refuse to be stuck in the station, to

Go get yourself reliable transportation.



Things either fill space or make room.

What you own should not also own you.

Everything's highest form is servitude.



Make the space to be loved and be lover.

This becomes impossible amongst clutter,

So, out with what takes you no further.



Give it the time it requires to happen.

Even though your patience it's sapping,

Somehow find a reason to keep laughing.



Overstimulated minds and toddlers whine.

So unplug from it all from time to time.

We each have a child to parent inside.



What makes you healthy is unique to you. 

Eat nothing but what your senses approve,

And pay attention the whole way through.



By neither apathy nor habit be overtaken

Because whenever one of them's forsaken,

It blames the other for troublemaking.



When injured, rest, reflect and recover,

Or else one pain will turn into another.

Guarding wellness puts crises asunder.



Everything deserves full consideration -

How to respond when in conversation and

When to slip into silent contemplation.



The day's an hourglass filled with sand;

Each soul you meet a grain yet so grand.

Take every chance to extend a kind hand.



You're already ready to see on your own.

True clarity you have found and grown.

It perceives, no matter what is shown.



Leave preferences aside and get moving on,

On toward your own daily innermost dawn,

On toward the whispers from your beyond.



Though you feel ready enough to burst,

Before you set out to quench this thirst

Decide which priorities will come first.



Turn toward the changes; face into them.

Courage and crisis make a perfect blend.

Each is the one that to the other tends.



Don't believe you have to have it nailed;

Learn lifetimes from those who've failed

To make a plan by which you'll prevail.



If you wish to dodge a stampede,

The thunder is not what to heed;

Sense of direction is all you need.



The moment you rise is when to begin.

Instead of expecting this chance again

Use today to grant the wishes within.



As every drama has a cast of performers,

Every regime has its mass of conformers.

Have you memorized any scripted orders?



To live for the future is to live a lie,

And the past is a life you must let die.

If this isn't obvious only you know why.



Your skin is a symbol: your boundaries,

Where thriving safely ignores disease,

As important as fresh bark on a tree.



When emotions rise and rage, face them.

You will be threatened but never taken,

Because you already decided to awaken.



Let your heartbeat be your guide today:

It races when there is something to say

And slows when life is perfectly okay.



Pay attention to what ebbs and flows and

Look past to what neither comes nor goes

This is the You without highs or lows.



Tend to the gentle upkeep of your body.

Head swiftly to bed when it is yawning,

And get up when a new day is dawning.



Be generous without sparing.

Be unique without comparing.

Be hilarious without caring.



Are you there more than you realize?

Ask someone with a fresh set of eyes -

As denial can put on a clever disguise.



Love each one and have no expectation.

Come what may, find cause for elation.

Your smile has a life-giving vibration.



Time will sweep away all these details.

Your explanations' uses eventually fail.

Take this chance to pull back your veil.



If you love what you do, share it freely

Because once you manifest your dreaming

Wealth has already started streaming.



That coat was perfect for those storms

And now it is a bit tattered and worn;

Go on, take it off and wear it no more.



You'll find shiny things along the way,

Some will save time, others will waste.

At your mind's yard, do guard the gate.



If someone is certain they are in crisis

Little you'll do to turn them from this.

Do not address what they claim's amiss.



You'll be ready, while others hesitate.

You'll get up and get out and navigate.

You'll be the one who sets it straight.



You've gotten all this way without it -

Though its lack has sent you into fits.

So you had no need, not one little bit.



Focus on what you're feeling, not doing

And with time, skills will keep accruing

And with ease, you will keep improving.



A bounty is soon to be bestowed

From all of the seeds you sowed,

Blessings of a garden well-hoed.



What made you think you could accept

Not what's special but just what's left?

Don't, that habit will leave you bereft.



What they do may even deeply annoy,

But irritation is the mind's best ploy.

Work on yourself; see past this decoy.



Though their words can easily rile,

Set your opinions aside for while.

This time, listen and simply smile.



Whether it feels true or non-existent,

It's freeing you from past resistance:

What's taking over is called patience.



You might not be as aware as you believed

Of who you are and of this Self perceived.

You're beyond anything you can conceive.



All preferences are misconceptions,

Your mirror's long-past reflections;

Use fresh thought, not recollection.



All of the signs are in front of your face:

This is meant to be a journey, not a race.

So, which thoughts is it time to replace?



No one needs lessons to sing with heart;

To do so, training doesn't help you start

To discover your source and stand apart.



Think of a time when you lost your voice

And see if you had already made a choice

To silence your inner expressing of joy.



There's nothing to buy, nor to believe,

No one to follow, nor for you to lead -

Only roles to shed, here and now to be.



In your recipe, they would be the spice:

Some pungent, riling; others mild, nice.

Flavoring is just that - not core advice.



You're going to be relearning as you go,

Because of the gradual way life unrolls:

You do, and do, and then deeply know.



You'll assume you've been here before,

The familiar faces and feelings galore.

It's a misjudgment you should ignore.



Whenever you run straight into a block,

Some surface of sheer, impassable rock,

There's an entrance to find and unlock.



The sun will certainly beam once more,

You will bloom even better than before.

Thank the darkness and what it was for.



Keep yourself a little bit unsatisfied,

With something still irking your pride,

So that when you roar, fear will hide.



A fool tries to fit a week into a day,

To do it all, rushing every which way.

But life's finer things require delay.



If an "I love you" feels transactional,

Stop. Give an "I love you" intentional,

Letting your "I love" be unconditional.



Forgive yourself first. Have you truly?

Mentally, emotionally and spiritually?

Let go. You deserve to live peacefully.



Be at peace with disappointing others.

Wiser to beware their fog of druthers,

Smoke that blinds before it smothers.



About what comes first, next and last,

That stale advice belongs in the trash;

Live life in to out - not front to back.



What does succeeding have to do with it?

Put your focus solely on the movement.

All lose who think in terms of some win.



You can let go of understanding your why.

Just watch it unroll in its own due time.

You are the first line - it is the rhyme.



Not everything need be quite so obvious.

Over-explaining proves you need to trust

That a knowing flows through each of us.



If it were time to, you'd already know.

It is time to produce, so less is shown.

It is time to recognize your very own.



When exploring, don't cut your own path:

Duck, bend and turn keeping close track

Of landmarks you may need to get back.



Keep on. Forward! Ignore those voices,

The ones that offer distracting choices.

Momentum will drown out side noises.



Small gains are better than ones grand:

Proven by an hourglass versus its sand.

Prove this yourself, by your own hand.



You will need neither to blame nor adore

Their endless pursuit of more and more;

Just set your own goal and of it be sure.



Where does your mind travel to soften?

Where does your heart need no caution?

Where do you find yourself most often?



If you could see more of what others see,

You would be energized with an urgency

To hurry up and make what you believe.



Delay for as long as your ego requires.

Existence can wait a much longer while,

Or you and Habit could just reconcile.



What you're doing is sowing the seed,

Tomorrow's steadfast and fruitful tree

That'll sprout, spread, shade and feed.



You're given a gift; how do you then treat it?

Do you look for what still seems incomplete?

Can you look deeply into how you receive?



For all of the effort you put into selling -

Into figuring out what's most compelling

Could you let your values do the telling?



Your ego is too concerned with results.

That is why it pressures you to consult,

Trying to save itself from the catapult.



Which one's routine, which one's ritual?

Which one of your habits feels spiritual?

Which inspires you to be unconditional?



Old superstitions might bully new ideas,

So to their warnings make it very clear:

You are doing something original here.



Remain right here in the grip of the storm

Knowing deep inside you're safe and warm

Going through this in order to learn more.



Your difficulties are not all dreamed up;

The uninvited are drinking from your cup

And need you to tell them that's enough.



Keep on thinking about your alignment,

About what you need to be most vibrant,

About how to align with today's timing.



Resist their current before you get caught.

Spend more of your time where you ought,

Outside the flow of your river of thoughts.



Expect the mind to deliver you doubt.

Give it some attention, just not clout:

Stop and listen if the warning shouts.



In food and fitness, spend generously.

Be well through these - not medically.

You will benefit more than physically.



As good as it is to know your dislikes,

Which activities fill you with delight?

Choosing these will shine your light.



To the thoughts that have yet to let go,

That in years haven't one lesson shown,

Tell they are unwelcome in your home.



Unkind thoughts must be thrown away

Lest over anything else they gain sway;

Let love and understanding own today.



Recognize when you have nothing to say

And see if some words come out anyway.

If so, to your silence more attention pay.



There are 1,000 paths to 1,000 places so

Welcome the one in front of your face as

A road to be enjoyed at a personal pace.



Of all of the things that instigate strife,

The most serious ones work from inside,

Wearing your cravings as their disguise.



Become better at knowing the way back

Because when you find yourself off track

You need only draw upon workable facts.



You're wonderful, not for what you think

But for what is more You than instinct -

For the way your love keeps you linked.



Blaming yourself for the setting sun, or

Bragging over wars your ancestors won?

Neither serves, so both can be given up.



It's possible you're being too relaxed

About what you'll need to stay intact.

That said, start keeping better track.



Speaking holds an energy that recreates,

Breathing life into all one contemplates

Echoing - ears to mouths - it circulates.



Pull yourself away from too much study;

Memorizing turns a mind's waters muddy.

More information is what you don't need.



Rebuild yourself, brick by sturdy brick,

Habits as cement, to the good ones stick

Aligning as you go, mind each next pick.



Does your destination still feel true?

Is it where your heart is leading you?

Is it close enough to be within view?



Perhaps you could use a bit more training,

Some help to reach where you are aiming,

Something to give your lion some taming.



Wake from daydreaming. Get to work.

Put your schedule and structure first;

Digging a well takes more than thirst.



Thoughts have a smell - some truly stink.

But when you journey to emotions' brink,

Forgiveness will freshen up all you think.



Making yourself out as hero or villain

Is limiting - even if it feels fulfilling,

A role too flat for anyone to be filling.



Say no, give in, and try to say no again.

Was what you felt worth that hesitance?

Was anything unmet by being resistant?



Turn right around and knock once more.

But this time knock harder on that door,

And when it opens, go on in self-assured.



Stick to your principles. Do not budge.

Be as unmoved by a shove as by a nudge,

For you answer to your own inner judge.



Your passion is your power ignited,

Which is more than feeling excited,

It is being what's just been lighted.



Something unmistakable fills your eyes.

Something about you can shift the tides.

Something in you just makes this right.



If only you knew how beautiful you are,

Those other voices would sound very far

As you took your place among the stars.



Treasure the aging of your lovely being.

Even greater than what's for the seeing:

How you keep birthing deeper meaning.



Do take the time to reach out and touch

Those who are not asking for much, just

To be felt, a bit of connection as such.



It is all about the words that you use;

Everything else just serves to confuse.

Expression is beautiful from any view.



Lasting changes arrive in odd packages

So when receiving, the best practice is

To be as open to gifts as to challenges.



This is your chance to take Life's dare:

Look it in the eye with an impish glare

Go after what's most precious and rare.



Beautiful, lulling spots along your way

May have much to show but little to say

So look more than listen - do not stay.



Pick any friendship to take measurement

Of how much is heard, how much is said.

If there's an even mix it is far from dead.



Sharing ideas is a partnership practice

That both opens up and lightens baggage.

Such an alliance can brave any passage.



Take advantage of every chance you can

To tell your story where it's in demand.

Wit accomplishes more than the hands.



Go on, keep enriching yourself with

Daily-earned savings of inner wealth

By doing things that treasure health.



Laughter is priceless. Treat it as such.

With fun folks, spend time, and much.

If hurt, it eases the need for a crutch.



Treasure those who find ways to despise;

Their misdirected abilities to recognize

Are the ones we use to regress or to rise.



Key people will be there along the way,

With just the right word to know to say

To instruct you in how not to overpay.



Take not as genuine that which is guile:

A venomous snake also appears to smile.

Stand still and watch from here awhile.



Before you vouch, make sure they qualify.

Listen to accomplishments, not to alibis.

Choose making sure over answering why.



There's a time for nurture, a time to go;

Needing parenting is a thing to outgrow,

Shedding the seeking of anyone's say-so.



Some say that love is a fiery emotion,

As intoxicating as some magic potion.

No. You are a wave. Love is the ocean.



If even now they are still looking back,

Reminiscing, narrating, rehashing past,

Are you in fact with those who will act?



When you need one, a teacher will appear

To grant lessons or to speak into your ear

What your soul has been waiting to hear.



You mean more than you will know to

People who just seem to come then go:

Your impact doesn't need you to know.



They're all part of your transformation

Regardless of the details or situations

That feel to you like inconsideration.



Your defiance in the face of the storm

Is a noble yet misdirected venture, for

It comes, not to surprise, but to warn.



The ones who fret are constantly plotting,

Rooted in all of their conspiracy-spotting.

Outgrow them so fast you need repotting.



Part from those who sell light to the sun

Whose goal is to do a thing then be done;

The gift is to find how to serve everyone.



Those who find problems, always find more

Though you carry solutions to their door.

Stop trying to win their inner civil war.



Take as long as you need to come to peace

To the spot where inner accusations cease

And things don't bother you in the least.



Perhaps what you have to do is be there

To convey to someone that you do care

Or that of their struggle you are aware.



Your role is to simply start the legacy,

To be the first who helps others to see

That giving is the best way to succeed.



Smile at challengers - right in the face.

Via clever surprise, leap and give chase.

Via wit and will, put all in their place.



It doesn't matter how long it takes you

Because that which appears to delay you

Only proves it's impossible to sway you.



Be aware, just when you hit your stride

And the conversation leans to your side,

It's your ears that should be open wide.



And with whom you had most in common

Are those who misunderstand most often

That as you change, toughness softens.



There are benefits to looking your best

To inhaling all the air into your chest

And inviting the world to be impressed.



There are all sorts of little mysteries

Things that are tantalizing to believe;

Don't get tangled in retelling's weave.



Place your focus beyond your own self

To things that can make everyone well;

A broader vision is, by itself, health.



Is it better to have well-sharpened wit

Or just an awareness of when to give in?

Sometimes the one who loses truly wins.



One way or the other, you are an example

Either by letting your reactions trample

Or taking steps that are lovingly ample.



What may sound like a rough delivery

Is your latest lesson's outer packaging

Well worth whatever inconveniencing.



Don't get caught up identifying them -

Allies or adversaries, foes or friends,

Since everyone benefits you by the end.



Some people just prefer to oppose you -

It's something you'll have to go through

To discover all that you're supposed to.



Stand by your truth in every situation.

No matter what their latest permutation,

It still goes against your inclination.



What you consider to be the right thing

May instead be your identity deflecting.

What is your ego still busy protecting?



The trick over time is to entrust more

Of tomorrow to those closer to its door

As you mature into awareness evermore.



You have to get to it, without thought.

Thinking can get tangled and distraught

Where doing gathers only what it ought.



Be mindful of whatever deal you request,

Because it does not serve your interest

To finagle a way out of a pivotal test.



Avoid saying things you don't truly mean;

Be quiet in the vastness that lives between

What's to be done and where you've been.



Ever since you rounded that corner,

Why has nothing returned to normal?

Because you're on a new way forward.



There are 100 ways to go where you wish

This would be obvious if you were a fish,

No paths - a whole sea in which to swish. 



Find a good friend and tell it to them;

Hear how it sounds and then notice when 

They ask you to say what you said again.



An uplifting friendship is best of all;

It comes to find you whenever you fall

And goes on reminding you to stand tall.



Enjoyment, comfort - these aren't enough

To be your complete expression of love.

You are Everything, not a part thereof.



You be the one who decides your beliefs.

Think about every single thing you read.

Be a pupil for only as long as you need.



Give what you can and give it more time

To mature into something one-of-a-kind

Into what invites you beyond your mind.



If you will work, you will not be denied.

Even if the weather decides to be unkind,

Don't be among those who sigh, "I tried."



Listen only lightly to those who boast

And claim of anything to know the most.

For now let them serve as humor's host.



Take lightly the commentary of a critic

Who preferred to look for the fault in it

Rather than stand for, beside or within.



Not everybody likes laughter or a smile

From not having shared either in a while

But yours will remind them to reconcile.



Help others, but take care of yourself

So you're giving from a place of wealth

With both physical and financial health.



Whenever big words surround small deeds

It means someone is stuck in their weeds

And needs to first find a place of ease.



There is no lack, not in any given thing

You simply decide, then get in the ring,

Step, tuck, advance and take your swing.



If you stay focused on one single goal,

You might lose sight of You as a whole.

You are love itself, you are not a role.



The news might trigger your deepest rage

A feeling you had put in a thought-cage.

Face it and rise to a more honest stage.



Some people say things that truly hurt

That make you feel as low down as dirt

Which is where growth awaits rebirth.



Receiving an unpleasant offer

Will train you never to waffle

Declining all except awesome.



Forgive yourself for the role you played

In triggering someone's unpleasant ways.

You helped lead them out of their maze.



You're naturally and constantly training

Everyone around you to avoid complaining

So the goodness becomes self-sustaining.



Infatuation with dates, facts and names

Is one form of love but is not the same

As daring to touch and risking the pain. 



How long will you force yourself to hear

Words that roam, drift, wander and veer

From what your heart has made so clear?



Being who you are is being nothing else,

Except that which makes it clear to tell -

That you honor life itself by living well.



Fall no farther past where you are safe.

You know the place you should never stay

That can far more than just time waste.



Bad examples can provide the best advice

Needing to neither be packaged nor nice.

Listen to every life for the lessons inside.



Small decisions have the biggest effects,

With greatness or not, each one connects,

So create a schedule your mind respects.



The best lessons are easy to understand

But hard to await patiently as they land

As lightly as a butterfly upon the hand.



You need more than walls to make a home

And more than money to live on your own:

You need to love who you are when alone.



There are golden people in your history

Reminders that you are more than worthy

Of a loving living and of living lovingly.



Everyone may say, but you won't hear or

See it until you can look in the mirror

Loving yourself day-by-day ever-dearer.



What they see is only a delayed reflection:

Where you were, not where you're headed.

You do not owe them their misconception.



There are those who need you to react

To keep their inner world view intact:

Lovingly disarm all their petty traps.



You succeed alongside who you befriend;

Time is the money you must daily spend

Funding those on whom you will depend. 



There'll be no problem you cannot solve

If you open your heart to forever evolve:

Watch all you let go of simply dissolve.



You are your best when you do far less;

You are not You when you harbor stress.

You are so attuned when in quiet quest.



So much is perfect the way things are -

You should inhale before raising the bar:

Enjoy what's close before traveling far.



Stop measuring how long it's been for now.

You should stay focused on what, not how;

You've already made your ancestors proud.



This is a necessary stop along your way

To reorient, assess and some homage pay

To your process, but you must not stay.



The time for celebrating has moved on -

Not to say that to relax would be wrong,

But it's time to do what keeps you strong.



What you're making will last a long time.

Others will use it along their own climb.

Find their future thanks in subtle signs.



Allow your example to be a bit of a mess

So others can relate and not feel stress

As they try to copy what in you is best.



It's good to live by a code for a while,

To focus more on discipline than style,

But quit before your rules merely pile.



Of the powers beyond your understanding,

You should be eager, but never demanding

To learn from each how to keep expanding.



Something incredible is already waiting

So very nearby to where you are staying

Nothing you do will cause any delaying.



The way you express your joy is healing

Especially when your laughter is peeling

You away from every unpleasant feeling.



When you can create as part of a pair,

And offer up your soul completely bare,

You'll channel power found only there.



Protect your center. Protect your core.

Above its strength there's nothing more

Important for you to be working toward.



It's alright to let your schedule bend,

But you must return to what you intend

To see your original goals to the end.



Thinking will lead you deep into a canyon

And once it gets you there, may abandon; 

Your gut is a more trustworthy companion.



Putting positivity into every word said

Signals gossip's vultures high overhead

To flap elsewhere for the dying or dead.



Symptoms are rarely immediate: be aware.

If today's choice is made with more care,

It gives tomorrow so much less to bear.



It won't come from speaking your mind -

It will come from being quiet and kind.

Watching is what will help you unwind.



Ask everything you allow into your body,

If it will keep you safe or make you sorry,

And refuse whatever answers, "Probably."



Go over each thing you do, thoroughly,

And check that it is still unswervingly

Taking you to where you want to be.



Pull yourself away from a daily routine

To talk to someone you do not normally,

Who is sure to have just what you need.



Keep the strategy but change the tactics

Because so far you've only been half in,

Though more of you is ready for action.



Revisit some of your less pressing goals

To see which ones are now stale or cold

And which if any can still serve a role.



Protect your nest but know when to stop,

So you do not end up hatching some plot

That doesn't build upon what you've got.



When you hold firm to what matters,

Even though all else be torn to tatters,

Commitment is your rescue ladder.



Least important is where they come from;

Rather be sure you share the same tongue

In matters of positivity, work and love.



The conversation is not worth your time

Unless it is of that special engaging kind

That makes each one of you look inside.



Time for a transformative connection,

Not just one that upholds convention,

So start by asking a better question.



That question you assume to be relevant

Comes from a practice all too prevalent:

That right answers are the ones to get. 



If you don't get just what you expected,

You must see that it is you being tested

For what you yourself actually invested.



How you send someone off after a defeat

Is a chance to perform a most noble feat:

To bow to their graciously given treat.



No one's going to show you the right way

Ask the supposed experts though you may;

This is one part of the price you must pay.



Nothing you think was done so in malice;

Certain people simply have a special talent

For showing you where you're off balance.



You're not interested in going back to

Letting your needs be met impromptu.

This is the reason you do what you do.



Life has a way of always getting better

If you follow this advice to the letter:

See goodness in every season's weather.



Dedicate yourself and get right to work

Ignoring anyone who says you can shirk;

Shortcuts turn into self-inflicted hurt.



Do not obsess about it - just calm down.

Something inside you knows the way out.

You will never need to think about how.



Do you go where the welcome is warmest?

Or are you now willing to brave the forest,

Where favorite comforts may be poorest?



It is the result of each and every habit;

The routine is what reaches to grab it.

Your hidden power is in your patterns.



You've been growing all this for years,

Watered it with blood, sweat and tears;

You cannot stop until everyone hears.



Just relax and lean back on experience,

Proof you needn't fret nor turn furious

As life likes you to not be too serious.



Get things ready for what's on the way.

What needs to go and what should stay?

Make haste as if you had only this day!



And while they are sharing their worry,

Permit your mind to go off on a journey

To anywhere else and return in no hurry.



So much more of this mystery would clear

From knowing more about those most near,

But knowing that is not why you are here.



If conversations take a superficial turn

Don't let your impatience ignite or burn

The listening lesson you need to learn.



It only seems petty because of your eye

That's trying to focus elsewhere nearby

Instead of upon this answer in disguise.



Be firm, don't let anyone dissuade you.

Your decision was key, and made through

A steady, unshakable willingness to do.



Be flexible and open to their suggestion

Because regardless of a hidden intention

Every new idea raises a useful question.



The future you dream of, is it external?

If so, it is but the smallest of a kernel

Of a harvest that is already internal. 



Speak your mind, then hold your tongue.

What your words do is not easily undone;

Wisdom is verbally lost and silently won.



If you aren't being heard, then be quiet

Until you determine to once again try it

With whichever words best calm a riot.



You're en route, no matter how you feel

So why not go on and sweeten the deal by

Choosing a lighter definition of "real?"



Give out compliments; wait for none back.

Whether as words or thoughts, you attract

Adoration in too many ways to keep track.



If you find yourself repeating yourself

Take your common sense off of the shelf

For it's time to listen to someone else.



The memories help when times are tough

But reminiscing because today is rough, 

Misses the fact that here now is enough.



Keep on creating - no matter what comes,

Don't try wondering when you'll be done

Just focus on effort mixed in with fun.



If you're doing it right, days speed up

And fill with things you had dreamed of,

When you keep expressing what you love.



It's not mysterious, complicated or profound:

Sometimes you're up, and other times down.

You need to travel both high and low ground.



You can't be expected to master it all.

In some areas, your standards may fall.

Get up until you once again stand tall.



You might not be at peace with your past

Until you reframe those circumstances as

Your life birthing itself through chance.



Those who want better will try to do so;

Don't be a judge of what you don't know.

Many who struggle try hard not to show.



There are so many powerful words to use.

Your holiest act is to mercifully choose

Which to deliver and which ones to lose.



If you were asked about your intention,

Would your answer also include mention

Of your living in that same direction?



Once you are done wanting and getting

Come to the place of intention-setting

Manifesting more in living by letting.



You became whatever your life required

Just as you now keep yourself inspired:

By always aiming a little bit higher.



It is you who brought all of this about

Without so much as a scream or a shout;

What if you were to let everything out?



Eventually there are no leaders to model

Just one path-paving intention to follow

Keeping you, in the best of ways, hollow.



Go ahead call it dark - call it so lonely

The whole point is that this is the only

Set of stairs up to your innermost holy.



Assuming you prefer your power to last,

See through the mob's tendency to dash

And to your own intention be steadfast.



Were you supposed to live, frozen there

As if their fears should get you scared?

It is alright to say you just don't care.



Temper prowls with mouth open wide,

To devour whoever will not move aside

And take the flow of events in stride.



Again they're asking you to play a game

Which each and every time ends the same:

With you wondering why you ever came.



You grow apart, even without any strife

This is purely the ebb and flow of life

So don't let theories or tales run rife.



Stop rummaging through all that trash,

And sifting other people's campfire ash;

Let today be today and past remain past.



What happened, happened for a reason:

To turn all of your doing into being,

As you unroll this feeling's meaning.



If your words are missing the hearer,

Perhaps you must make it much clearer

Via means that bring you even nearer.



Conversation is such a life-giving act;

Half skill, half ritual best kept intact

Doing more than resuscitating facts.



You may not have been seeking this fight

Yet here you are, asserting you're right

Instead of using this to deepen insight.



Be ever mindful to deflect the chatter

That leaves woven thoughts in tatters.

Get right down to what truly matters.



You come, you go; you shed, you grow.

Only in darkness can you see it glow:

A star in the direction you must go.



Allow them to frown upon your quietude,

To disapprove and demand more of you -

You keep still until you have no mood.



It is important that you grow a feeling

About whatever you hope to be achieving

To direct and drive your every dealing.



The hardest decisions you have to make

Are pointing out which excuses are fake

And letting them go for your own sake.



You are obliged to use your critical mind

To think your own way through this time.

You must do more than hope it goes fine.



Use what you gain to let something go;

What is overgrown has no room to grow.

Your inner landscape could use a mow.



Where you get stuck, take special note:

This is where there's no room for rote,

You will become the expert they quote.



Sometimes, for a time, you need to quit

So you can come back with a lighter grip

And by letting go, be true to your spirit.



Check on their work before they return.

Pay those who sell, just what they earn.

In business, charity is not the concern.



This image of success that you've drawn,

Is there some example it is based upon?

Or is it the sketch of an unseen dawn?



Any hesitation to do as they suggest,

Or urge to stop listening to the rest

Is your intuition saying what's best.



Whenever you're tempted to put up a fuss

Consider the urge itself to be humorous:

A burping baby ego starting to spit up.



Perhaps the best part about a second try

Is that you get to focus entirely on why

And really get to know the inner guide.



It comes from where you least expect -

The guidance you will be needing next,

So be open and have both ears prepped.



When things slow down it's time to stop

To be thankful for that which you got,

And even more so for what you did not.



Tip your chin up, because you don't know

Who is watching and needs you to show

An example of gracefully making it so.



Above all, it's time for you to reflect,

Await patiently and with all due respect

So when it comes you will deeply connect.



You did, it did not. That is that. It is so.

Thoughts run everywhere yet nowhere go.

Let today's be straightforward and slow.



Your body requested the right remedy

And hopes you paid attention especially

By silencing that know-it-all tendency.



When it doesn't seem to be about you,

But about what you can selflessly do,

You're rich because you contribute.



Though you may be swimming in tasks,

And to offer help, no one seems to ask;

Realize your abilities are beyond vast.



Only trust advice that is proven by time,

Not green buds from someone's grapevine.

Who has the ripest fruit for your mind?



You have thought all this through before

So trust in yourself and revisit no more;

Build up with all of that as your floor.



Work with yourself a little bit longer

So you can become a whole lot stronger;

It's almost time to divide and conquer.



You've done so much - stop and remember.

You grew this blaze from just an ember

And given love that will last forever.



To find the way to your heart's desire

Look at your list of priorities entire

And rearrange your day as it requires.



Where others stopped is not far enough;

Because what they considered too rough

Is just where you must drop some stuff.



Because time is the only asset you get,

Part from everyone you find wasting it

And study anyone who's schedule is set.



Certain incidents need to be forgotten,

Not because they're particularly rotten,

But because they don't help you broaden. 



Tricksters will come to spread confusion

And offer you more than a few illusions,

None of which you need to be choosing.



"I don't understand why they act so..."

Is an attempt to forget what you know:

That everyone has their own way to grow.



Your anger is part of you for a reason:

To defend you against emotional treason

And arm you with your own inner legion.



You can predict what's going to happen

Based on all of their previous actions,

So you already know just what to fasten.



You were speaking before you were fluent

And building before needing a blueprint;

Continue to trust in your own movement.



Whether intentional or just by accident,

If it keeps you from your accomplishment

Then it is the opposite of an advocate.



The reason you're being treated this way

Is not to have negative things to replay

But to learn when it is time to disobey.



Right after you reach this next plateau,

See all the new directions you could go,

But to each and every one of them, "No."



Take a closer look at what you are doing:

Are you nourished or still just chewing?

Put finishing power into your pursuing.



Moving forward means not looking back.

You have allies who'll guard your tracks.

So all that is left for you to do is pack.



As you are bringing life to your dream,

It is vulnerable in this place between,

And needs you to leave all who demean.



You are comfortable here for a reason:

You know how to dress for this season;

But your wardrobe is becoming uneven.



If you need more focus than balance,

You'll do well to stick to your talent;

Work where you are best challenged.



Have your gratitude and yet remain open

To all that comes with what was chosen.

Your future with so much more is loaded.



Hopefully by now you look back and see:

Progress walks closest behind adversity

So ease is exactly what you don't need.



Or you can find out by taking a detour;

It helps to go where you're not so sure

To recognize the one path that is yours.



If you dislike the term procrastinating,

Then think of it as an internal debating

Only won through attempts, not waiting.



As you align, the ideas will overflow,

Blending with what you've already grown

To make something that is all your own.



You have to trust that greatness builds,

Never outward from more and more frills,

But ever-inward from daily-honed skills.



Keep your head down. Work on your craft,

Close the workshop door. Let in no draft.

You need to be driven - not well-staffed.



Gather up treasures as you journey along

So that even though your journey be long,

You will only become increasingly strong.



They're wise to as far as they have gone

And past that, can only steer you wrong.

Reposition yourself to where you belong.



There is most certainly a price to pay:

What you were in exchange for this way;

Every tomorrow in exchange for this day.



Keep yourself organized because of this:

Whatever response will need to be quick,

And you must know where everything is.



You have done well to not get roped in,

But before you declare an official win,

Look well at what next thing you begin.



Living is only ever about how you feel:

Though motivations are easily concealed,

They are all your mind regards as real.



In the faces of those you don't yet know

Is where to catch a glimpse of your soul

As they reflect to you what they behold.



Must it sound the way they say it should

To make a difference or to even be good?

Are you here to be, or to be understood?



Everyone is traveling somewhere special,

So if you can't help to speed their vessel,

At least help them keep to their schedule.



Hold this ground. Do not advance.

Plant both feet. Own this stance,

Unmoved - as if deep in a trance.



Your habits are as waves in your ocean,

Keeping everything you start in motion,

Drowning out every unproductive notion.



It does not have to feel good every day

So long as it still makes sense to stay

On a path that heads this general way.



If you understand that seasons change,

Why not embrace your own heart's range

And think none of your moods strange?



When will you allow yourself to be You?

Stop saying you don't know what to do!

You know it all, including the truth.



Whether you remember how to or not,

Be grateful to whatever you forgot,

Because enough is as good as a lot.



The decision is not between that or this

But whether to consider a loss or a win 

As the same, and just keep surrendering.



Since there are so many forces at play,

You do best to let go, come what may:

See how everything happens anyway.



Busy? Tired? At the end of your limits?

Experiencing life via tasks and minutes?

On your way home or just paying visits?



Here, new habits don't look like much,

And so for now, let faith be your crutch

Until they manifest what you can touch.



Become entire

As air is to fire:

Give up desire.



Rather than impress,

Take sincerity's test:

Use gain to own less.



The time for travel will soon be over,

Not like turning from dazed to sober,

But like rising up from being covert.



It's just the words, and nothing else,

So don't invite your high-minded self.

Fewer words generate greater wealth.



Observe you yourself listening to this,

That so simply put - everything exists,

Including there being no need to get it.



Once they go, then you'll have the gift,

Not all at once - rather a gradual shift.

You've been chosen because you uplift.



Someone is waiting at your next plateau

With climbing details you need to know:

Which rocks to dodge and which to hold.



Even in the darkest one of your moods,

Even if there is barely a sliver of moon,

Toward that, all of your attention tune.



Change is taking its own sweet time,

But it is coming as you will soon find,

So stay flexibly strong, body and mind.



You are the result of all your trials

All these years over all these miles,

So seal with love all your old files.



Console yourself - it is not about you

But about what they are going through,

Searching their inner world for truth. 



You are wise to make this deeper root,

As winds of change are blowing through

Removing whatever can be pulled loose.



Sift their words for pebbles and chaff,

Ideas that do not keep you on track or

Untested advice that may set you back.



Now get outside - breathe in some air.

You stagnate in here. Go get out there.

Be out with Nature and without a care.



You root in the past more than you know,

As proven by that certain way you say no

Whenever you forget 'as above so below.'



Put it off for as long as you need to,

But eventually you must tell the truth

About what is no longer in you to do.



We never lose that which matters to us;

It simply asks us for a new level of trust

When it transcends what can gather dust.



This is the time to look it in the face,

To be duly firm, to put it in its place,

To embody power that embodies grace.



The choice is not between this or that,

But between your path and a given track;

One's forever forward, the other, back.



First, line everything up the right way:

Closest to what's most important stay;

Head into yourself, not into the fray.



It is good to have two different goals -

One to dream toward and one you can hold

To make it impossible to ever grow old.



Neither win the future nor beat the past

But completely do today's clearest tasks

And when you can, be thorough, not fast.



Being understood will never be required.

Just keep finding new ways to be inspired,

Looking only and ever and inward higher.



What it leads you to, through, and from

Are new ways to grow in truth and love,

And challenge what used to be enough.



Work on your words until you are sincere

Not just saying what they expect to hear

But expressing what is loving and clear.



Improving your process should come first

Because it does more than quench thirst -

It unleashes flow not occasional spurts.



So much of it lives within the delivery

That you will excel as soon as you see

What you can give instead of receive.



Open your arms. The world will come.

It wants to respond with so much love

And meet you in your pursuit of fun.



Your intensity will never be a match

For what easeful alignment can catch

Nor for an itch only time can scratch.



Shrinking from it can only shrink you

So be brave and come out to introduce

Yourself and offer terms for a truce.



Generosity even toward your inner miser

Because by opening your arms out wider

Your inner creator becomes the decider.



Now close that door that is still ajar -

There's plenty to do here where you are

And you are the most qualified by far.



The planning is done. It is time to do.

Enough thinking. That time is through.

Begin the routine and begin with you.



Remember that this is only a projection

Of your thoughts and more so intentions

Even the ones you prefer not to mention.



It's time to change your whole approach

Even if this calls for getting a new coach

Because habit on progress can encroach.



Too comfortable doing what you're doing?

Know you only gain ground when improving

Because this requires conscious choosing.



You'll be amazed. Just take another look:

See how much everyone loved it and took?

Remember which spices you used to cook?



Offer a question instead of a defense

Whenever asked to explain your intent;

Where you're going - not where you went.



Activities are not what get it done -

Aligning, like a blossom toward the sun

Is how an easeful life should be run.



It's already here, just line things up

Like using a waterfall to fill a cup -

You'll be getting more than enough.



When you are done, it will just be shed;

When other things interest you instead,

Not a bit will dwell inside your head.



Some prefer to take it all in at once.

This is a habit that is rarely undone,

So just tend to your own digestion.



If it irks you - how they keep taking,

Ask that inner voice so busy blaming,

"What's to steal if we're donating?"



Of all the things you "have to do,"

Which ones are habits to cut loose?

Which ones lead to something new?



Beware of advice that is based upon greed,

That implies there is something you need

To win it all or from something be freed.



Some things cannot be explained in words:

These are the things you'll never unlearn.

To study them, get up when it's your turn.



Hold your humor close to your heart,

To greet with laughter, not tear apart

Anyone bumping into your day's cart.



Give yourself permission to move on,

To be freed of being Thought's pawn

And raise the sun of your next dawn.



A rut is good, both to measure how deep

A thought can dig a hole and go to sleep,

And how high to escape you have to leap.



This isn't one to think your way through,

But one to find you being something new

- a rainbow with never-before-seen hues.



Thank your thinking and now let it rest.

For what comes next it may be but a pest;

Heart is your home and mind but a guest.



Mistakes are the soul of transformation,

Teaching you focus through tribulation:

Less judgment and more contemplation.



It is as foolish to blame your reflection

For a blemish you see in its complexion

As it is to find the fault in the tension.



This is a wonderful journey. Do you see?

By deciding today will go just perfectly

Because joy is in choosing momentarily.



That was only something you used to do,

Congratulations! You cut yourself loose.

Look ahead. Never dwell. Simply refuse.



Though it betrays your values, you do -

To keep the peace and make it through,

But this takes an improper toll on you. 



It may not be time for the actual words,

But you can start simply living it at first

So the blossoming can go on undisturbed.



It is time to be more than an observer.

It is time for you to go even further -

Into what inspires your deepest fervor.



It is good to face occasional doom

To be reminded not later but soon

To keep your adaptability in tune.



Stand in this. Be in every bit of it -

Even parts that you'd rather not admit

And when you do, labels cannot stick.



The answer does not need to come to you,

Rather it is you who will come to truth

By daily doing what it is that you do.



Starting requires you stop sitting there;

With no special feats or any oath to swear

It's about beginning regardless of where.



Gifts can get thrown out unintentionally

Unless we decide to sort conscientiously

What belongs inside versus on the heap.



Are you sure this is what you should do?

Yes? Then refuse to take on anything new

Until your schedule reflects your truth.



Keep going - some days will be very easy

And others may make you feel very queasy

But a climb leads to where it is breezy.



Every day leave one unkind word unsaid,

And with better food for thought be fed,

And you'll be the owner of a clearer head.



You have one job - to keep progressing,

Not to be measuring or second-guessing,

Or even spending your time confessing.



To help you decide, think of it as this:

Any of those you will eventually quit,

But the right one is here as you sit.



Change is only necessary if you say so;

Staying the same brings benefits also -

Like learning how to maintain a flow.



Enough of trying to meet their demands

That always use the work of your hands;

Root your two feet. In stillness stand.



You can listen regardless of interest,

And hear if a heart is being addressed.

If not, words are just making a mess.



Thought-circles will dizzy your peace

For years until you tell them to cease

So you can distinguish west from east.



Preparation will be behind you soon,

Like the dawn behind the afternoon,

You are emerging from your cocoon.



Figure out a way for it to remain fun

Because you'll recall when it is done

How fully-enjoyed, not how well-run.



A mind on the task and a heart on hand

Will ensure you are doing all you can

To help some fly and let others land.



There is little use in being a judge

Of that which has no need to budge so

Dismiss your inner court with a nudge.



If you can look past each circumstance,

And past every opportunity to advance,

You'll see your genuine, actual chance.



Without any of it, you'll still be you;

Not your oldest things, not what's new,

But what notices points to your truth.



So much of what you carry is irrelevant

But you simply do because it's expected;

Why not bring more emptiness instead?



It is by being present that you have seen

The many places to which you have been,

Going everywhere, yet remaining serene.



Less fun alone, so find temporary guides

Who invite you to explore places inside

And take a tour of all you have tried.



You can be comfortable you chose right,

And at very least you prevented a might

From ruining your well-deserved delight.



Despite distractions' attempts to lure,

Whether you seek or find, do be sure

To keep your desires few - and pure.



No one else can direct you exactly what

From your daily rituals you need to cut

So decide for yourself which digs a rut.



You will come across it everywhere else

So why not start right here with yourself?

Work solely on your own highest health.



In matters of eating, fitness and wealth

Find one way each day to push yourself:

Do what you learned despite what's felt.



Spend time on bringing people together;

You are the sun in their day's weather,

The kite to which they love to tether.



You need to inhabit this space above all

And let other activities around you fall

Away as you rise, stretch and stand tall. 



For now, just find out a little bit more

So that you build on a foundation sure

Something that will work and endure.



Don't think much about whether it will,

Just pay attention to honing your skill

And forget even the idea of an 'until.'



Be patient until the right people come.

Until then, there is work to be done -

Refining yourself and being your One.



When it is right, there is no knowing,

No trial with evidence to be showing -

Only a feeling that just keeps growing.



Take time for your own sake, take time.

Down the long road awaits the sublime.

Your impact is a poem; you are one line.



Recognize this place you've reached -

Proof you learned by letting life teach

And take you from your familiar niche.



If you wish it would all go more quickly

Your mind is heading somewhere prickly;

To your heart's time just keep sticking.



Safeguard by investing in your own idea,

Something that uses your current career

To look where your vision is most clear.



Prosper by pressing in one new direction

In which fine-tuned powers of perception

Can repurpose your well-learned lessons.



Sometimes none of it will make any sense

And you'll have to decide which elements

You're going to acknowledge as relevant.



You need a day off - a day just for you;

There are many ways to see this through,

And each must leave you nothing to do.



If you're hearing from just one source

You're ignoring life's far greater force

Available all along your entire course.



It is time to reach out to other ones

Who can help you get much more done -

And show you what you find most fun.



It may not matter as much as you think,

Though this may feel as if it's a brink;

It really is as fleeting as one blink.



No need to decide, simply be as you were

And notice when the heart begins to stir

And when all else just becomes a blur.



Use your mind to point to every option,

But let your heart pick, no precaution;

This is the journey - not some auction.



The pieces are coming together perfectly

With some imagination you'll clearly see

Not far ahead, the breakthrough opening.



Keep your space clean and keep it clear

So that confusion has nowhere to appear 

And inspiration knows it's welcome here.



All your tasks contribute to your goal,

Provided you can do them from the soul.

So tell them they are part of the whole.



You weren't meant to tend to everything

Since you're the only one who can bring

A life expressed with your special zing.



Focus is waiting for your sacrifice,

Not to ensure things turn out right,

But to re-aim with sharpened sight.



Do you think of the end when you begin?

Do you lead with your nose or your chin?

What comes out is based on what went in.



You don't go backwards by doing it again

Though toward the longer way you'll tend

As everything within asks, "Now when?"



Deal with it before it gets any bigger;

So far there is nothing it can trigger

Since you outdo it in will and vigor.



It is going to go exactly how it will,

because nothing goes differently until

You can master the art of being still.



Look at what you are doing to yourself

To see whether it benefits your health

Or just echoes what someone else felt.



The new way awaits your certain say-so,

Which comes once you head-to-toe know

It is solely about imagining your flow.



Set out with more than a running start

To give even more support to your heart

As it does what makes you stand apart.



Ranking yourself from expert to novice

Only adds sand to a desert of nonsense;

Put your focus on remaining conscious.



When given the words you prefer to hear,

Treat your ears as eyes that keenly peer

Past them to what quickly draws near.



Lead your way by being perfectly clear

Because whether or not they even hear,

This is how the heart learns to steer.



Remind those who matter that they do

And you will expand what is good into

Infinitely more: the power of gratitude.



When someone resonates deeply to you,

Pause to find out what else they value

And this may uncover more inner truth.



Perhaps not what you'd preferred,

Perhaps even noticeably awkward,

Perhaps just the only way forward.



The best you can do is to give it time,

Not having that impatience of the kind

That expects the fruit without the rind.



When all the inputs start to overwhelm,

Remember you are a captain at the helm

Able to sail toward any chosen realm.



When there are too many new things to do,

Is precisely when you need to kindly refuse

To be pushed, pulled or in any way moved.



Let it out - you are allowed to complain

Because it can bring relief to the brain

Which is not meant for carrying disdain.



Don't let their wording steer you wrong;

You're where you wanted to be all along.

You'll never need to argue to be strong.



And if they were to do as you requested

What you built would never get tested or

Show you who else is actually invested.



Once you give away what matters most

You become the universe's gracious host

Keeping nothing but your openness close.



Take the time to pick what matters most

By looking at the things you keep close

And revising your list of who you host.



A breakthrough need not be announced

Because it becomes even more profound

Without interruptions from the mouth.



Enough of the items - on to the action;

For planning brings far less satisfaction

Than genuine, meaningful interaction.



No need to feel burdened by the pile;

When you can at least once in a while

Laugh and give it your silliest smile.



Take a moment to see it from the finish

And see what stress this does diminish;

To be most effective, remain a witness.



Choose someone to be your muse today.

Someone right nearby or very far away

Who is for you the same as a sun ray.



Neither overrate nor downplay this time

All of the work you put in to harmonize

But let your own conclusion materialize.



Training is the reason you act this way.

The grooves were cut deep so you'd stay.

Escape options? You have a whole array.



If you let your thoughts linger here,

You'll train them in a loop to steer;

Decide and let it be perfectly clear.



Perhaps the truest words you can bestow

Are ones that tell the unwelcome to go

For they do not help your garden grow.



If someone is inviting you to criticize,

Be an example of other ways to describe

What simply is, versus what is desired.



Some lift you up and some wear you down;

Those who tend to leave you with a frown

Are telling you to go tread new ground.



To you, it feels like a poisonous thing.

To them, the holy ritual of complaining

Is worth their unquestioned sacrificing.



You needed it, but now complain no more.

It helped you sweep your feelings' floor

In preparation for new blessings galore.



Anger is a defense. Now end your war.

You do not need to fight against or for

What was only ever meant to be a door.



This is your cue that it's time to rejoice

Because you have grown into your voice

And so replaced obligation with choice.



This thing you are choosing not to say

Will end up getting in your future way.

Spend time while you can afford to pay.



Welcome the tears. They are a good sign:

You are tender and vulnerable by design.

Love - you need no one else to be kind.



Your mind has no clue of what is perfect

And just uses that as a ruse to deflect

From how key it is for you to connect.



A slow start should always be preferred

Over a haste in which lines get blurred

To be fully present for all that occurs.



Whatever stays stable will resist change

And this applies the same to your brain,

So spend more time with the unexplained.



What you don't question picks at you

To pry your weakest assumption loose

So reevaluate your whole way through.



Put more focus on the how than the what

And more time with the if than the but;

It is the sharpening that makes the cut.



Pay attention to your mood when you pay:

Ecstatic to be making financial headway

Or eagerly anticipating your next foray?



It is only important that it is yours,

Not to feel justified in starting wars,

But to be poised to open new doors.



If you get tired, take that as your sign

That part of you is getting left behind.

It should be a deepening - not a grind.



A challenge that makes you feel queasy

Need not be gnawed on until it is easy;

Feed it to one who can enjoy it deeply.



As unpleasant a thought as it may be,

Things are only ever called upsetting

If unflattering angles are reflecting.



And if you feel the need for a change,

That is easy enough for you to arrange;

So much more difficult to just remain.



Whenever you think what's needed is aim,

That's just the ego casting false blame;

A most perfect life would look the same.



Even if you're only gradually gathering

The things others say are worth having,

You can lose what should be mattering.



Most of what that left behind is useless,

Except the part forcing you to be ruthless

In turning predatory thoughts toothless.



You're able to work hard, that's proven.

But it is time for a new level of doing:

One that lets creativity do the moving.



Perhaps success was your assumed goal,

But another journey - one of the soul -

Will deepen your definition of whole.



What now offers you feelings of stress

Is actually a simple point-of-view test

In both understanding and forgiveness.



Whether it's accurate, sensible or not,

You should just decide what you've got

And decide to make it add up to a lot.



Have a kind of clarity that stands guard

So that it makes a fence round your yard

And other things will no longer be hard.



Your thinking has a storyline it prefers

A familiar place where it always returns

But it is time to show it the universe.



Take a trip - in this moment here now

To a place reachable by one sworn vow:

"Love is the only voice I will allow."



What challenges you, offers you a choice;

Realize the reason you're given a voice

Is to speak sense that quiets the noise.



Whenever possible, look to make rituals

Because that which you can make habitual

Is an investment paying daily residuals.



Finish. Bring it to some kind of close

So this can join with the larger flow

And help water other things to grow.



A habit might help you forget to grow

By praising you for just staying aglow

But you can burn brighter, you know.



Move on, because you are well past due

Leaving this place, despite its great view

And despite the lack of a dramatic cue.



It is time to say that this is enough,

That you are ready to call this done,

That you are finally prepared to run.



Need not one more drop of information

To step into a life of your own creation.

Pack up. Set out. Call it all exploration.



That is the sea, but you are on land;

So you must go where there is sand,

To hold both elements in one hand.



There's a time for hearing, but not now;

This is the time to tilt your head down

And work in isolation, no matter how.



All your doings should be more rigorous,

So nurture whatever keeps you vigorous

And map out all your inner wilderness.



And now either choice will be correct

Because you've decided to first reflect

On all you have, versus what you'd get.



Whatever was given will be taken away.

But what you've lived will always stay

So use it like your personal treasury.



Everything is going to take more time

When you interrupt your own deadline;

Make your schedule clear, not implied.



You are best fit to negotiate

Because you know how to wait.

Next, prepare to demonstrate.



Knowing what you have is no small feat,

Like tasting ingredients in all you eat

So take your time by taking a seat.



Your mind is less inclined to let go

Than it is to use new things to grow,

So surprise it with a whole new show.



Think deeper about what is driving you

As you ponder each and every new move;

One step back shows two ways through.



Most important to keep in mind is why

So that when you are asked to decide,

You are already so perfectly aligned.



Understand it is alright to disappoint,

Because someone always becomes disjoint

When you use your power to self-anoint.



You are not your skills, you are more -

The embodiment of what all is in store;

You are an exception, not a therefore.



End your search for the right question

And let the answers get your attention

By walking away from comprehension.



If your mind plays with any doubt,

It is at the same time filtering out 

The truth of what this is all about.



And now you are going to have to trust

Because if you are to keep on rising up,

Learning goes from a should to a must.



Now is not the time to look for a limit,

Or hunt for unnecessary things to omit;

It is time to inhale and expand into it.



It may feel new or seem like a leap,

Or like a hike that's a bit too steep,

But all this is is your time to reap.



Patience, because you're still building

Making real by virtue of sheer willing

So today let nothingness be fulfilling.



If you are so lucky as to find laughter,

Better everything will come right after

Since you'll already have what matters.



Perhaps you just don't yet understand;

So before a complaint becomes a demand,

First get your point of view to expand.



Advice that does not treat you as more

Is but an invitation to politely ignore

While you do what you came here for.



And now open your hands for all to see

That you've shared with them everything

And that now they must all let you be.



You are most you when you are a channel,

And things greater than you could handle

Get done simply by lighting your candle.



The habit of taking a small step today

Is what gets obstacles out of your way

And keeps those who waste time at bay.



You may simply need another reminder

To be neither a seeker nor a finder,

But to be still yet be all the wiser.



Keep everything in order and in tune

Because health is your greatest boon,

Making you rich right now, not soon.



Being busy is another form of fear -

Preferring to ride rather than steer;

Take the wheel, but stop right here.



Do you find yourself overtasked again?

Do you wonder when this cycle will end?

Are you willing to love yet not bend?



Out of love you have invited this delay

But soon enough, you must get underway

So prepare for what you'll have to say.



While it's best not to assume malintent

Sometimes subtle harm is what was meant;

As if a landlord, do not let them rent.



To not go back, you must make a choice.

To go on, you'll need to use your voice.

To enjoy going, you'll need to rejoice.



Most important today is what you'll eat,

More so than where you point your feet

Because it decides what you you'll meet.



You got too comfortable - look around:

You blended into your own background.

You are hereby no longer spellbound.



You can walk away from compromise

If it requires you to close your eyes;

If it does not, it is the way most wise.



You'll be served best by putting it down

It is what holds you here on the ground.

Let go and let the wind take you around.



It is a myth, the search for direction,

At least in the way that others mention.

Do not search for - set your intention.



On the surface it acts like opportunity

But from a distance you'll plainly see

It's a well-wrapped box of busymaking.



You'll find out by being open to anything.

Be open to anything by expecting nothing,

And expect nothing by loving everything.



A spoken word has a creative vibration

That can create and spread inspiration,

So listen to what has sound foundation.



Cultivate the very best of habits.

When you find a good one, grab it.

Success waits for routine to happen.



Say whatever must be said - but kindly.

The mind opens when dealt with wisely.

Words work best when delivered mildly.



Be steady in who you see yourself to be

And yet willing to change into anything

That your vision tells you is necessary.



Leaving your comfort zone just to do so

May be you resisting today's given flow.

Your instinct already knows how to go.



Shift your focus away from an audience

To something somehow not as obvious:

It is in the doing that you are blessed.



They've given their trust; you owe them

More than promising words and sentiment

You must now deliver something definite.



It's good to have a tendency to jest,

But not if it's just a way to deflect

From admitting your preciousness.



Just as there are losing ways to fight,

There are even wrong ways to be right.

Let flow itself be your utmost delight.



Along with being more thoughtful,

You need to be patient and softer:

What does your heart want to offer?



Keep up with changes in your body,

Gauging your strength and flexibility

Because they decide tomorrow's ease.



It will take them a while to understand

So rather than leading them by the hand,

Prove by passion that it will be grand.



Within or around you, force won't work,

Neither to influence, to scare, nor to irk;

Your own inner power will simply smirk.



Do not be drastic - that is ineffective;

You should try to be more introspective

So that your gains are all protected.



When you don't wish to be singled out

Those who point, criticize and shout

Remind you to take a different route.



An emotion is lightning without thunder,

But certainty gives it a deafening rumble:

Decide your weather, don't run for cover.



Just as it's useless to blurt out sounds

Before they have words to help them out,

You'll have to wait for it to come down.



Bravely will make the safest way there.

Those in hiding will hide and not dare

Because of your certain, confident air.



Remind yourself that this is not a race

And that bandits also like a good chase;

No prize to win - just yourself to face.



Their praise might fill you with pride

And put a bouncier step in your stride,

But You are why your smile is so wide.



After a while, you won't be able to stop

Your very own rhythm won't let you drop;

By keeping tempo, you'll reach the top. 



Whatever feeds on fear, you can starve

Through a harder part of who you are,

Giving those termites stone to carve.



It can feel right - chasing enemies down

Until you catch up and turn them around

And see it's you yourself you have found.



As with the year, you have your seasons

And each has its own different reasons

Behind what it would rather be feeling.



Listen to yourself, but not too closely

To the inner chatter talking mostly:

It is just a guest - you are hosting.



What you do is not who you are

Just as the shine is not the star

You eclipse what's been thus far.



You have a pattern when you get tired

And end up doing things that backfire;

If you decide, this can all be rewired.



Something in you would love to blurt out

What's on the inside edge of your mouth,

But you know of an even cleverer route.



Live for today, though not recklessly -

Live in a way that uses time effectively,

But makes time to stop for serendipity.



You have forgotten how difficult it was

When you were first doing what you love

Now you easily know what to get rid of.



Let it out, no matter what impedes you.

You must live what you believe is true -

Take the step that brings You into view.



Tell it your way, with nothing held back

Because others need your example to pack

For their journeys off the beaten track.



Do your thing, needing to join no group

That may dilute the flavor of your soup

Or borrow time you'll need to recoup.



Some will let you know they are timid

Not to let you down or make you livid,

But so you can help them be rid of it.



Take what's needed, give back the rest

Just like taking air into your chest;

The rule is that enough is what's best.



Spot the thoughts that don't nourish you

The same way as your liver knows to do -

By checking everything coming through.



Take your time on things that will last.

Less gets absorbed when you just go fast.

What is mindfully done honors the past.



Catch things before they become an issue

Just as your organs faithfully do for you;

Clear inner pathways hold clearer truths.



You will need something to go between

So that everything goes forward easily;

What could help everyone else agree?



Make sure that everything is connected,

Even what is hardest to get redirected;

Join them yet also keep them protected.



Powers must ultimately be combined,

And the tricky part in joining minds

Is freeing them yet making them bind.



Things that are solid hold their ground

And whatever tied to, they'll pull down;

Just figure out what needs to be bound.



Go find that place between open and wild

Where you have the potential of a child,

An imagination that's anything but mild.



Keep going because you are so very near

To another spot where the path is clear

Enough to prove that you belong here.



If you need proof, just look back a year

To see no one single thing got you here

Yet you knew it would one day be clear.



If you leave, you can never go back

To the same place - you lose track;

But new adventures you will attract.



Timeless rewards go to undying faith:

You cannot know what wonders await

All thanks to your guarding the gate.



You sit in the theater of the uncertain,

Ready and able to pull back the curtain.

Rest assured, the play will be worth it.



It should be no mystery, how it affects

Just look to all those past failed tests;

Tell it thanks and no, again and again.



Your balance has benefitted just as much

From all the habits you never picked up,

As the ones you've never tried to hush.



The vast unknown is no cause for alarm;

Nothing out there can do you any harm;

Like a trained bird, call it to your arm.



What you've done the last 1,000 days

Is what decides whether it's too late

Or right on track or a bit of a wait.



Other things may make you feel full,

But take in more of what's original;

The best ingredients are intentional.



Look hard at the different distractions

That offer you temporary satisfaction

And don't prepare you for real action.



Stand guard at the gate of your mouth

And keep what preys upon judgment out

By honoring what being well is about.



So your want doesn't turn to greed,

Before you get what you truly need

Go do for someone else a good deed.



Here in your world filled with stuff,

Just about how much of it is enough?

Precisely the amount that feeds love.



Because that one little inconvenience

At the time may have made little sense,

But was a seed and is growing benefits.



Right now it will be hard to know why

And you will waste your time if you try

So just find a way to mindfully comply.



Just done daily, some things dig a grave

Just done daily, some things years save

Just done daily, choosing earns or pays.



Forget about what could come next,

Just keep letting air into your chest

And back out again. Forget the rest.



A few key things you need to increase:

More water, rest and nutrients to eat

For the clarity you're going to need.



Right now it is about being stable

And doing well what you are able;

And keeping the rest off the table.



They have even more ways to get you upset

You've been dealing with them but instead

Try new tactics they would never suspect.



To not get yourself stuck halfway in,

There will be no better way than this -

Take time learning, and then be swift.



You should stay and see this through

For everything else it's connected to

And just do whatever you have to do.



Don't step outside of it, not just yet

Because the chapter that's coming next

Is guaranteed to become your very best.



Which of your talents has most impact?

Which does more than keep you intact?

To which one do you keep coming back?



The notion that you haven't done it right

Is fine once you see each mistake as light

That shows you a bit more in your night.



If they tell you you have to choose,

Do they also have something to lose?

Why can you not be left to peruse?



That other way has never worked for you

It's time for you to be breaking through

The habits that have produced this issue.



Love yourself and you'll see another way

One that you overlooked just yesterday -

One that would serve well, come what may.



As convincing as other methods may be

They're all just volumes in your library

You're now doing, not just researching.



Drink your wisdom from the cleanest cup

Hold your high standard, no matter what

Shrewd judgment is another form of love.



It only takes one decision to turn this

Into what can give power to your spirit

No one but you needs to know or hear it.



You're on the brink of a great big shift

By choosing what feels good and uplifts.

Entire destinies change just like this.



You're not obligated to be what you were.

Look back to see your past as a vivid blur.

So decide anew based on what you prefer.



True, you cannot be in both places now,

Though imagination claims it knows how;

So, to this one present, you should bow.



Everyone is looking out for you

Interacting to help you improve

Through everything that they do.



Press on yet give in when it fits;

Water crashes but can quietly sit.

Power uses what ways you give it.



You are not here to fulfill their goals

Nor are you here to do as you're told;

You are here to be imperfect yet bold.



Your calling is a task you cannot finish

Because it has the opposite of a limit;

What you can do is love it this minute.



At the place where your shovel gets stuck

Is where others before you had to give up

And where you must decide to get tough.



Draw from where you've been and improve;

Greatness follows no preexisting groove;

It follows those who make their move.



Just by showing up you open doors

That lock behind you and with force.

Should you still go in? Of course.



If for a moment you could recognize

Through it all, how easily you glide

You would stop being so surprised.



Can you see yourself as a conduit?

Realize you're not here to "do it."

Let yourself just sit here and intuit.



The rules you rage about were all fake,

Placed along your path for you to break

And live a life none but you regulates.



To some, you are the utmost authority

On thinking about patterns creatively.

Be proud of this and live accordingly.



Before life can be what you make it

Life's ears need to hear you say it -

That you've now chosen to commit.



Thoughts that make you breathe easily

Remind you how to both live peacefully,

And to just as deeply, change everything.



Your purpose isn't to finish your tasks,

It's to be the one brave enough to ask

Why things need to be moving so fast.



What today holds is different for all,

Some will rise and others will fall;

You are blessed to heed your own call.



It took foresight to avoid being misled.

And since you were brave enough to shed,

Your lightness helped you to move ahead.



The beauty of where you've gotten to

Is not that it shows what you can do,

But that somehow you already knew.



You know a thing is far from dead

When you see its skin being shed;

Is your discomfort being misread?



You can if you say, can't if you don't,

And things will go on even if you won't;

You will change all to which you devote.



You've decided. Let that be that.

To decide without turning back

Generates the power to attract.



Don't get addicted to people's trust

Or start telling yourself you must;

Fixed thinking, like old iron, rusts.



Stubbornness only needs one false step

For others to heckle under their breath;

Reasonability works much better instead.



It's those you didn't choose that matter

Those you can neither fire nor flatter -

Who are steps on your spiritual ladder.



For a while it can all start to get tangled

Things coming in from every odd angle;

It's just to show what you can wrangle.



Take the day off for today. Look ahead.

Prepare for whatever is coming instead.

Tomorrow only pays whoever invested.



There was a time to reach far and wide;

Now it's time to play close and tight

Not forever, just for a little while.



You might let them dispute your worth,

But let them know what you value first

To bring the whole thing down to earth.



It helps to know which you're up against -

Someone who doesn't care or an opponent;

To hear what their words really meant.



The best skill is knowing where you are

Even if stormy winds blow you very far,

To be able to spot your guiding star.



The words don't even have to be hostile

To upend your sensibilities for a while

But reorient and go get back your smile.



You're looking at it from the wrong side

Although you feel you've already tried;

Find someone who can act as your guide.



You may find it hardest to obey, 

That which you now call your Way

Until your heart has had its say.



It will all come together perfectly

Like an intricate mesh of circuitry

If you keep moving this fervently.



Slow down, stop moving so fervently.

That is not leading toward harmony,

Which is now all that is necessary.



It's easy to get caught up in the day

And the circus of what people may say

But just keep making your own way.



There will be another time for sleep.

Today you've got big promises to keep

And need many hours to plan this leap.



There will be another chance for rest.

Today is for your record-breaking best

So prepare as though this were a test.



Sometimes the stretch is going to last

Far longer than you can bearably grasp

So draw from tales of adventures past. 



If you're known as the one who stays calm

And the one with whom everyone gets along,

You will draw to you others who are strong.



Face up to the changes and adapt to them.

You're better now than you were back then.

So keep this in mind and head in again.



Anything is bearable if you have a plan

So don't join the nay-sayers if you can;

Keep on climbing your own mountain.



What is it that you're waiting to hear?

You have proof your thinking is clear

And the feeling that you're very near.



Today it's about continuing on

Regardless of feeling the pawn;

You are at the verge of a dawn.



Don't think so much about how they feel.

You're at opposite ends of a turning wheel

And neither can either's momentum steal.



Sometimes it's best to plow on through

Despite the reasons they're giving you;

If given as an excuse, it's unlikely true.



There doesn't have to be a reason why.

You just have to decide to and then try;

A bird doesn't question when in-flight.



Those who enjoy your presence the most,

Love you because you behave like a host

And seem proud enough of them to boast.



Of all the things you love to do,

Those that will most uplift you 

Fill others with that feeling too.



The reason they consider you a resource

Is that instead of making it about force,

You've wisely followed nature's course.



If you intend to keep life at this pace,

The best parts will blur past your face;

Slow down enough to experience grace.



Before you decide, remember your norm

And now imagine it got lost in a storm:

What new foundation would you form?



Though they have quieted to a grumble,

They still sound anything but humble.

Keep composed. Preserve your thunder.



Find someone you can use as a model

In how to support and yet not coddle

Those who are beginning to dawdle.



What you do may sound very interesting

To others, but do you find it riveting?

If so, perfect. If not, start pivoting.



These attempts you've made are just that -

None a final version - each one is a draft,

Or a sketching, but not the finished map.



Of all of the ways to live your life -

Identifying, helping, easing strife -

Forget about fixing. Pursue delight.



Of the things you should be talking about

Negative small talk should never come out

Let praises and plans control your mouth.



For as long as your values align

Your happinesses should coincide

And you can be each other's guide.



A day of kindness costs so little

So even if you're feeling brittle,

Do something to share a giggle.



For what it's worth, keep holding on

Even though the thrill may seem gone

Thoughts of brightness bring the dawn.



Whether or not they show their support,

No diversion to which you could resort

Would be worth it, for time is short.



With many ways in but one way out,

You may be wisest to go on without

Until you know what this is about.



It may take a shock to make you believe

But the facts were not given to deceive;

There are habits you must forever leave.



It's been brewing for quite some time

And now you can't pout, deny, or whine;

You can only stop, accept and realign.



A chapter closes before the next begins

Whether or not you found it interesting;

Not everything important is riveting.



Perhaps toward the very thing you feared

Is where your journey should be steered

Perhaps that is why the feeling is here.



Meeting their deadline is nothing new,

So it's time you were finally through

And started on what appeals to few.



You can't learn this one soon enough:

Life starts when you stop doing stuff

And is loveliest when you won't rush.



You don't have to fit the normal story.

You don't have to seek standard glory.

You will only have yourself as jury.



There will always be some price to pay

Whether you take the easy or hard way;

How much exactly? Only you can say.



If it were otherwise it wouldn't be true

So get some sleep, wake up and continue

And you will soon enough have your proof.



If you can pick one thing let it be sleep

Since the right amount satisfies the need

For your spirit to enjoy a full renewing.



Let comments fall like rain on your roof

Let them trickle all over or deluge you;

Let them come down, just never through.



There's no need to clamor for more

All will be delivered to your door;

Go to it then - not a moment before.



You get to write this story of life

So draft and craft until it is right

Better than your dreams at night.



To your relationships be most devout,

More than whatever you worried about

For to your bliss, they are the route.



No matter how urgent the tasks,

Partnership first, deadlines last;

You should not even have to ask.



Great joy swells from a greater devotion

As big waves rise up from a bigger ocean.

What is deep underneath your emotions?



Your next conversation is like a key

To unlock the inner door that leads

Deep down into your soul's library.



Take it gradually, using what you've got

Otherwise you'll put yourself in a spot;

This way it's easier to unravel the knot.



Your love is equally strong in all its forms -

The sunny one that keeps everything warm,

Or the one from which creations are born.



Some small circle safeguards your trust

To feed you love until you're stuffed,

So telling them everything is a must.



Hopefully you can see you're much wiser,

Much more observant, yet far from a miser

In how you used this to open up wider.



Sometimes it's hard to see from up close

But what you have done deserves a toast -

Daring to be more vulnerable than most.



Your focus should be aimed at one thing

Or else you won't do enough of anything

To enjoy mastery's wonderful feeling.



After the longest stretch take a break

And see what's floating in your wake -

Anything there that you saw too late?



You won't even have to ask the question,

Won't even have a single need to mention

When you are living out your intention.



So long as you know your dependencies,

One by one, you can deal with tendencies

To deny, deflect, confront or please.



You have amassed some great friendships

The kind that you know will be endless

Because you laugh yourselves senseless.



They are easily your greatest treasure

Though there is no easy way to measure

How they fill your life with pleasure.



It's easiest once it fits some kind of picture

To help figure out what goes where quicker

And you can know if you end up the victor.



Once you are sure, then you have to press

On and on and shed all that brings stress

To make this a grand voyage, not a test.



Once you're creating, it's less about you

And more about letting it pass through -

The messages being sent from your muse.



Raise it high enough to see the heavens

But keep it where it is still relevant

Both in what's said and in what is meant.



You have traveled without expectations

And that has been good for contemplation;

Now it is time for conscious navigation.



Come up with an amazing story to tell

So whether or not a given day goes well,

You'll still be coming out of your shell.



How are you viewing it? Solely from here?

Have you looked down from the atmosphere?

And let your imagination see everywhere?



The act of creation is what gives life,

So everything else can move to the side

For you to be in this mode all the time.



It's more important to tell a great story

Although not for fortune or fame or glory

But to live forever as your own category.



Yes, it is going to look like obsession

To those in some passionless profession

But this is the path of self-invention.



History says you should do a bit more

To turn into real this vision of yours;

Feel free to make preparations galore.



Or don't prepare at all; Just improvise

If you find it too foreign to visualize

But try to have some feel of the prize.



Maintaining anything becomes difficult

If you don't know what it's built above

So take down what wasn't built in love.



Don't react to disappointment or sorrow -

Those without energy, seeking to borrow

What you are working on for tomorrow.



Free from labels of either bad or good,

Gone are all coulds, woulds and shoulds;

Try, whether or not you're understood.



This is an invitation to yet one more

Uncharted location for you to explore.

If you are willing, much is in store.



That place where thoughts like to dwell

Is simply their former hermit crab shell;

Out in the open is where you'll do well.



Though thinking you should is alright,

It may be tempting, but still do not bite;

There is nothing here worth the fight.



All it means is it's not yet your time;

Though you hear otherwise from the mind,

There is more left to peel of your rind.



Go over it again, for as long as you must

Being everything and anything but rushed;

More pressing bakes you a better crust.



It's not always your reflection you see.

Sometimes you are faced with what's ugly

To learn about how not to create beauty.



Look at it with your own eyes. Go. See.

Because the picture is still incomplete

And you must have it before you agree.



When it's right, everything easily flows.

When it's right, everyone already knows

Because you embody it from top to toes.



Take the time to ask about their stories,

About their hardships and their glories,

To learn how they outworked worries.



Since you know you can go anywhere,

Get yourself up and fully out of there,

Up to where you can take in fresh air.



For all your doubts to be depleted

And your heart to feel completed,

You may need the lesson repeated.



You really need to give yourself time

For everything to come together inside

Before you can take all this in stride.



Everyone hurts, so show them you care

And they will come in from everywhere

To support you - not just stop and stare.



Starting is going to take a bit of trust,

Often not knowing why, just that you must

So let today be one wholehearted thrust.



Above all right now, keep being faithful

Because they are all so quietly grateful

For all you're serving by the plate full.



Some days you may feel incredibly tired

And some days may feel improperly wired

But keep on going. You are so admired.



You know what you know when you know it

Before nor After have anywhere to stow it

Once you are at peace with this, show it.



Tiny containers only hold but so much.

Let this be big, bold, brilliant and such:

It needs to be awe-inspiring to the touch.



Keep your mind clear of things,

Of the What each detail brings;

Tie them all to balloon strings.



Speak up for yourself and say no,

Because that was not the way to go;

You need to stop moving to grow.



They are telling you all sorts of things

Except for that which tranquility brings:

Confusion squawks while certainty sings.



Do they deliver, is the question at hand -

Otherwise you are dumping hourglass sand

Into bottomless buckets of promises grand.



It's also known as coming around the bend

When you see you haven't reached the end

But even more amazing road ahead instead.



You're not doing this for anyone's reward

Or because it is just what you can afford -

You sail with heart, mind and soul aboard.



Some offer violence in exchange for love,

Whether in word, deed or all of the above;

Without delay, they are to be let go of.



A situation becomes harder out of context;

A vision will keep you from getting vexed

So keep picturing what should come next.



You can look at this in a much better way

So there will be even better things to say

Which will benefit you as soon as today.



There is a reason to craft your own plan

It is not so you can make more demands,

But so you can recognize where you stand.



It's as important to know what you're in

As it is to know when and where to begin

Once you decide doing nothing's the sin.



This is just a change in the weather.

This is the time to keep it together.

This is how you chose to get better.



Imagine your most wonderful version,

The one boldly going on that excursion;

You're already becoming that person.



You do not need to know much more;

Come here, behold yourself and adore

The one who exceeds what was before.



Do not fall for it - you are being set up

To return to what you were once made of;

Stay within the light of your self-love.



It's a story that used to trigger you,

But you know what you need to do.

You're able to go straight through.



They want you to stop and go over there.

But all that going will get you nowhere.

Consider: does breathing go get its air?



Regardless of that, this is already enough

Despite your doubting whether it was just;

Empty spaces are for filling up with love.



To make your decision, go get some proof:

Before you move in, you inspect the roof.

This is the time to be anything but aloof.



As soon as you let yourself call this hard,

You put more energy into being on guard;

What you cannot enjoy, you can disregard.



If you are looking to be in demand,

There is a one thing to understand:

Do with your heart, not your hand.



It is alright to invite a little drama

If it can be for your sentence a comma

And not drag on into an endless saga.



Silence is difficult for the maladjusted

By whom you find yourself interrupted.

Who cannot be quiet cannot be trusted.



Once you feel it, it will be known

Before that, it's hard to be shown.

Only what you are will you own.



Time is what you are letting them thieve

When you sit amongst but do not receive;

Their conversation starves you, so leave.



Think less about how it will sound

And more about just getting it out

It is truer to blurt than to expound.



With certain things you need an end date

Not to stamp their delivery early or late,

But so you can edge them off your plate.



Be kind to yourself through compliments

Ones that sound sincere and heaven-sent

And are unrelated to any accomplishment.



When you're rough on yourself they see

And yet seeming silent, silently disagree.

Live your response to their wordless plea.



Being good to yourself shines the light

That signals other ones to burn bright,

So treasure the darkness of your night.



Be as comfortable saying no as saying yes

Because making decisions is how you bless

Everyone you deal with and reroute excess.



Perhaps the only useful lesson you learn

When all you want is to stop the churn,

Is that your fire must continue to burn.



If you stay in this funk, you get to see

That those patterns have no originality

And that you need new ones in actuality.



Unobserved, you become your routines -

Triggers, reactions, then you in between;

Check tendencies with an eye that's keen.



Think of a better way to look at this

And then improve even more upon it

Why should best-cases have a limit?



You need to have a deep discussion

Rather than just diving straight in.

Gather viewpoints not instructions.



If you keep talking about it, guess what?

It is exactly what will keep showing up.

Words - for the mind's wheels - dig ruts.



It is important to be right where you are

Whether or not you feel you've gotten far

Because you need this in your repertoire.



Stop everything - rethink your thoughts

To see if an assumption's got you caught.

Do what you dream, not what you ought.



What if you made it work just for you?

When being selfish you can find truth.

When you are satisfied, others are too.



Would you rather help them look away,

Or show them by getting started today?

Paint with any color to get rid of gray.



There is nothing more you need to hear

From those who ongoingly pull your ear

Because you need concentration to steer.



To call one thing bad or another worse

Is like living under a self-spoken curse;

Find out and speak of what is best first.



Be open. Be open. Be open. Be open.

Let those two words rule your focus.

Good if thought, great when spoken.



You don't need their love - you need yours

To welcome them in, or open closed doors.

You need a love that comes from your core.



This is still a time of transition;

Whatever seems out of position

Is just slow to obey your wishes.



Yes, they may be taking advantage,

But it's nothing you can't manage.

Momentum favors what is slanted.



Even good habits end up in stagnation

Without fresh sources for inspiration;

When was your last genuine vacation?



There is nothing that you "have to" do

Except to stay uncompromisingly true

To what stirs up the passion in you.



Even though you feel caught in a loop,

You have actually already broken through

As proven by your new point of view.



Ignore how it feels right now - continue

Because what you've gotten yourself into

Points to what you are truly here to do.



There is a journey beyond being the best

That leads to a deep and clear happiness

Because it is beyond doing more or less.



All of the things for which you yearn -

Put them on the fire and let them burn.

Wealth is who you are before you earn.



They will be cleared out of your way

Once you learn they are here to stay

And it's you who needs to turn away.



Sometimes it is most fitting to fight

Rather than flee what prowls your night

It is time to unleash all of your might.



The reason you worried about it at all

Is that your vision was still too small;

On other dreamers, it is time to call.



Surprises do not change who you are -

They poke fun at the "easy" and "hard"

And remind you adaptability goes far.



Those who "do" to please, crawl.

Do, just for the joy for it all.

Do - whether you fly or fall.



Whether it is given or taken blame,

Or fault put on anyone else's name -

Bundle all of it up and set it aflame.



Stick to your price or give it away,

But avoid being a deal-hunter's prey;

Spot all the traps of words they lay.



Words that are more than an annoyance

That can't be dodged by mere avoidance

Have their antidote, same as any poison.



So their issue becomes no greater

Handle it now - there is no later.

Your path could be no straighter.



Do, because there is no other chance.

Flow, because you are part of a dance.

Love, because life itself is a romance.



Let today be your best self's womb

As well as every stale habit's tomb

By being all about now, not soon.



Focusing on the good ones or the bad

Is a socially-accepted way to go mad;

Live for moments you have, not had.



Growing into a sense of self-worth is

Like knowing what to do with thirst:

Best to find where water flows first.



Serving them can make a fulfilling life,

But keep checking on what lives inside;

Give it the freedom to revisit your why.



You aren't the one who made that mess

So back away from the chaos and stress

And tend to the task of your own nest.



Your first instinct is correct

So neither retreat nor deflect;

Instead, very closely inspect.



You need to be completely upfront, 

Even to the point of sounding blunt;

You as the hunter, this is your hunt.



Sometimes you can't escape the tangle,

So position yourself at a strategic angle

And rally everyone you need to wrangle.



Understand they are struggling through

And let compassion flow from within you

Without judging what they are up to.



Let them find their own way now.

Let them have to worry about how.

Let your focus be on coming out.



Regardless of either luck or labor,

Regardless of coming now or later,

It will all work out in your favor.



This is your journey of self-expression

That from outside looks like obsession

But is answering your life's question.



It is uncomfortable to overextend

But you must, to see yourself bend

To break what's brittle at each end.



Soon enough, you'll reach your limit,

The place that might tire you to visit,

But where you'll reconnect to spirit.



Which part of it makes you tired?

Then ask your mind to be rewired

To form new ways to be inspired.



Did you drag the past this far?

Can you postpone the memoir?

Will you forget who you are?



At some point the habit must stop.

Lay down tonight and just let it drop

And awaken a little lighter on top.



Consider this your sign to move on,

A warning you've been here too long

And proof you should already be gone.



Not what you are, but what you become

Is what to wonder, not how to be done;

Focus a bit more each day on having fun.



This didn't yield because you were strong

Nor did it unroll because you worked long;

Like you, it opened by being focused on.



There was a time to be more intense,

Now that time is back behind a fence;

Here in the open, follow your sense.



There is so much you do not need to know

There is so little you need to love the flow

There are so very many ways you can grow.



After you've had your mighty brainstorm,

Now comes the time to consciously perform,

To turn hot nor cold, but perfectly warm.



Organize your thoughts. Give this time.

Get them to harmonize, not simply rhyme.

Seek to feel utilized, not simply fine.



Being authentic and relevant is good,

So long as you recall why you should:

To stand where no one else has stood.



Body and brain both need exercise

To keep you healthy as well as wise;

Work with each based on its size.



This may feel like a good time to plan

Rather than finish the mission at hand;

But focus and fulfill as only you can.



Not time for that - it is time for this

Regardless of whether you need to shift

Priorities rather than let them all mix.



Deciding whether to move on to the next

Implies that this you knows what's best;

Come up with a more thorough self-test.



Trust the closest examples of success

Rather than going away to be blessed;

Make results easier for time to test.



Look for some model to base yourself on

But don't hold on to that model too long

Just enough to right where you're wrong.



Perhaps difficult, but you must sit still

To meet your own restless ambition's will

And ask it which cup it's trying to fill.



You must trust in more than yourself

Both to strengthen your mental health

And expand your definition of wealth.



Schedule time to just walk away,

To give your mind space to stray

And keep predictability at bay.



And some connections need to be cut

To keep you from falling into a rut

Where it's hard to see what is what.



Exactly why does it need to be so huge?

Is your thirst only quenched by deluge?

How much of it all will your heart use?



Go ahead and be as specific as you can,

So precise you can feel it in your hand,

So clear you can see each grain of sand.



Once you admit these are distractions,

You can take more appropriate actions

To discover even deeper satisfaction.



Take this moment as your gift -

Not to be opened then dismissed

But to truly use what's within.



Get back in the habit, without excuse.

Whatever's in the way, do cut it loose.

Whatever's been learned, put it to use.



Do you consider your schedule your own?

Do you charge for all the time you loan?

Think of moments spent as seeds sown.



You know you've closed a life chapter

When your belly holds healthy laughter

Over your unique happily-ever-after.



If your ears could walk away they would,

But since they cannot, your feet should

Head to those who speak of what is good.



Only consider advice that has proof

That does more than just toss clues;

Trust what you can thoroughly use.



When you step away and then come back,

Push through if you feel out of whack;

Notice what gets you to stay on track.



Don't rush to fill every awkward silence

To avoid disapproval or outright defiance:

These are not the times for compliance.



It is healthier to be disliked

Than to bear even a little spite;

Be genuine, whether rude or polite.



You don't always have to be smiling

Or to be clever, quick or beguiling;

You should share what's underlying.



Seek to be visionary whenever you spend

Because more characters await you ahead;

Some will borrow while others will lend.



The way forward is the one most gentle

That will use your subconscious mental,

As you train it with some fundamentals.



Consider it hard and then it has to be.

Don't, and somehow it happens easily.

Think about how you want it to feel.



Before choosing, review your core values

Before you let one schedule become two;

Give what you are, not what you produce.



Partnerships are your best indicator

Of if you're ignoring now for later,

Or if you focus on today as greater.



What we accomplish matters little,

Goals alone are fleeting and brittle;

Make this day a poem, not a riddle.



If you knew the future, would it matter?

Today looks through a window of chatter

That tomorrow plans to open or shatter.



What feels like a child's shiny new toy

Should not be thought of as a real joy;

Long-lasting bliss is slower to deploy.



The art of living shows in your wit

So if you can, try to laugh about it

And invite everyone to giggle a bit.



If they need to complain you should say,

"Now that we know what you need today,

What is best for me is to be on my way."



Some things will never be worth doing,

Since they're not what you're pursuing;

Pour the time into what you're brewing.



It makes sense that you have fewer peers:

It means you've made yourself very clear

For the right ones to come find you here. 



A little more organization will help

So you can daily enhance your health,

Which is the essence of useful wealth.



When you yourself are traveling around

It's harder for you yourself to be found;

What seed grows in unsettled ground?



For the sake of days that turn upside down

Or endlessly spin you around and around,

Take the shortcut straight to safe ground.



When negativity shows up, it's only a guest

With lots of questions, but not with a test;

Work on the helpful ones, ignore the rest.



Get ready, amazing connections are coming,

Ones that will have all your senses buzzing,

Moving faster than they have been running.



Be open to meet those who slow life down

And force you to gaze, not glance around;

When they find you, you will feel found.



Greet even the most unpleasant surprise.

It is only a gust of wind. You're the sky.

It is only one second. You're all of time.



Be very strict about what you allow

Your mind to think - and also how.

Build later. Gather your tools now.



Don't focus on the path in the heat;

Focus instead on how your own feet

Are holding up and what they need.



Check in with others just to make sure

Your thinking is getting you to a cure

And dodging any bait that might lure.



Be flexible this time and change your tone

So your words don't cut right to the bone;

For now, let truth be quiet and your own.



Come out from that fixed point of view

That used very limited concepts of you.

You will become whatever you need to.



Life has added on one thing more,

Not to give you yet another chore,

But to show you yet another door. 



You are not here to rebuild or fix -

You are not here for any bit of this.

You are here to create your Oasis.



Sometimes you don't get to decide

What pushes your plan on its side;

Your job is to make things right.



The best use of your time is in training

Because it is both a way of maintaining

And a way to reach where you're aiming.



What can you sculpt on a finished statue?

Without hardship, what's left to react to?

In plainer words, no challenge, no value.



It's best to find others who are also seeking,

Because when people on a quest are meeting

They all stop starting and start completing.



A bird cannot move the wind, just each wing

Just as all you can do is each next right thing.

Attention to detail is really all you can bring.



Do you understand and uphold your worth?

Value your background, in fact, do this first.

Know your price like a farmer knows earth.



Bring the value of all your experience

And bring along all of your confidence

Because you already benefit all of us.



What you are feeling is a warming sunrise,

The hope that comes with a new enterprise,

And sheds enough light to help you clarify.



Add certainty, surprise, meaning, connection,

A sense of impact, a feeling of progression,

And you'll make yourself a life of perfection.



Hurdle the pit of overthinking

Wherein effort ends up sinking;

Be as certain as your blinking.



Giving is good, but keep in mind:

You can only share what you find,

So when searching, take your time.



You can make this a deeper connection

By embracing each bit of imperfection

And loving the art of paying attention.



How much of your day must be certain?

Do you have to pull back every curtain?

The unknowns keep all of it working.



The desire to take this risk,

And whatever it comes with,

Is the most important shift.



You are far from having reached your peak

Because what goes with being this unique

Is that you light the lanterns others need.



You lose one thing but always gain two:

First, a lesson and then something new.

Need proof? Just think of the past few.



For some, complaining is a form of fitness.

But only listen long enough to bear witness

To what's louder and softer - forgiveness.



Sordid histories can be so convincing,

Yet so long ago that you're squinting;

Instead, give your memory a rinsing.



Keep believing in being clear

For that is what keeps you here

And draws the best things near.



The shortcut never works out that way,

Though it does remind how not to behave

When next you choose to stick or stray.



In all of this there is a seed of joy

That to grow will need you to employ

Not a few thoughts, but a whole convoy.



You don't have to work - you have to align

In order to achieve anything one-of-a-kind:

Don't strain your back - ease your mind.



Make the decision. Yes, it's a hard one

Because it undoes what seems already done,

But in fact, you have only just begun.



It wasn't a mistake - it was necessary

To put a lesson in your bones to carry

So you can just know and not be wary.



They are offering you clear indicators

Of whether they do things now or later;

Promote yourself to chief investigator.



Put that down. You need to be learning.

You need to keep your interest churning.

What's obsolete you need to be burning.



Training your thoughts is not science

But pure persistence and self-reliance

And one great role model or alliance.



Accept that they ignored what you said.

Accept that they must clean their mess.

Accept that you have a garden to tend.



Keep building, even if it rains.

Keep building - even past pain.

Keep building - even yet again.



You shouldn't be there. You should go.

Moving ahead without so much in tow.

Be bold. Dig deep and just say so.



You need enough distance from problems

In order to measure and then solve them;

Step back, where your insight broadens.



Let everyone else choose their side;
  
Stay in between with arms open wide,

A reach that is both loving and wise.



What you're hearing isn't who they are

Any more than the melody is the guitar;

Are their words and deeds both on par?



They have certainly brought you abundance

Of what you want or else your comeuppance;

Gratefully accept this or risk redundance.



Even if perfection is your personal goal,

They don't care if it's half-done or whole;

They only seek some time with your soul.



The greatest kept treasure is your time,

The treasure chest is your state of mind;

You are wealthy when both match in size.



Even the worst parts can be entertaining

When you consider how silly is straining,

Like watering flowers when it's raining.



Take lightly this present role

And today will simply unfold

Without a complicated goal.



As of this moment, you are on vacation.

You have reached a dreamy destination,

Perfectly prepared by your imagination.



How often do you wake up and ask

If it's time to move to the next task?

Get an answer. Press on or turn fast.



If more of this will keep things the same,

Then the one decision to make is to change

Both your approach as well as your aim.  



Fear was being sold and they bought it,

Blame was being thrown and you caught it;

Do not pass it back, just gently drop it.



Be mindful of the words you select

To keep your mind's ears in check.

Try out new ones and then reflect.



Surely you'd be more comfortable knowing.

But what's coming won't do an early showing

Of all the new treasures it will be bestowing.



Part of your work must be public

So people can hold it and touch it

And share their love because of it.



Part of your work must be shrouded,

Somewhere you alone are allowed in,

So your center does not get crowded.



In order to help, they must first know

That you need help to continue to go.

They only see this by what you show.



It makes a great story, but misses the point:

Energetically things were just out of joint.

This is all the truth that you should voice.



Between passion and patience, pick the one

That's best today for getting the job done,

Or else will let you have the most fun.



If you consider what they might think,

Then how will you ever reach the brink?

Venture out to become the farthest link.



Do it for the sake of the adventure.

This way regardless, you'll treasure

The time all of you spent together.



In whom do you confide weekly about it?

Do they listen and occasionally comment?

Or do they bear witness so you'll commit?



Be willing. Be strong. Be rooted. Dig in.

When faced with chaos, perseverance wins.

Just deepen your stance and tuck your chin.



Be master of two things - yes and no.

Because they make time shrink or grow

Based on what they block or let flow.



It is more important to fully finish

Than to become slave to the image

Of the-one-who-responds-quickest.



When taking advice from the unhappy,

Convert it to something you can carry,

Go do the opposite of what went badly.



When you love them, it all becomes easy -

The hardest situations will turn breezy,

And your energy will flow more freely.



You're wealthy when you're generous,

You're powerful when you're curious,

You're immortal when it's effortless.



With more than enough on your plate,

You know it's time for you to delegate.

So find someone who can demonstrate.



It is more important to hold your vision

Than it is even to make right decisions -

Because clarity just absorbs collisions.



Who last told you what you ought to do?

Don't let one bit of it stick to your shoe

Trailblazing the wilderness you choose.



You always have the power to rewrite

Any part of this to create day from night

By opening to more inspiration and insight.



You'll have to collaborate with someone else

Because you should go no further by yourself

To guard and grow your own overall health.



In being the lone expert, there is no use,

For talent and skill are just a thin excuse

For why they just want to be around you.



You may have no trouble when you start

In doing something with less than heart,

But it will fall down, so take it apart.



Insincerity is still an untruth,

So in every word that you choose

Get your inner voice to improve.



We only think we know what we need

So the thing to do is look between

How it is and how it's perceived.



Why try to chart one straight line

To make such a steep uphill climb?

Avoid injury - not passage of time.



Whether a short or long-term friend,

They can help round this next bend

Like no other guide you have can.



Is there a schedule you need to keep?

Can you stop and enjoy what you see?

Is it alright to arrive eventually?



What you are looking for can be found

Without even needing to go look around;

More water beneath than above ground.



Whether or not they're even aware,

They're making you the best out there;

Why not take them up on their dare?



Or else nothing needs to change -

Because things that stay the same

Help you sharpen your aim.



While working is fine,

Worrying wastes time

(Waiting is sublime).



When you let it come to you

You know it is meant to do,

And not just something new.



Now be brave and put your name on it,

Because courage needs to be flaunted

So others see how to be undaunted.



If ever you hear yourself stiffen,

A habit put you in that position:

Offer all of it up for revision.



For the new things you needed to know

How many old did you need to let go?

Do you allow for the ebb and flow?



This time let the first thing end

Before you go start another again:

Learn to be your energy's friend.



One year cannot hold extra months.

One guard cannot protect two fronts.

You should do much less, at once.



First there's what you should be doing,

Then there's what you're quietly brewing;

All else you're just naturally excluding.



Let them fret over what the future holds

Because even once it all seems unrolled,

It will refuse to be completely foretold.



Although for you it was unexpected,

What matters most remains protected;

What you needed least, you deflected.



There's a limit to the number of tasks

That can fit inside your life's baskets

What should they hold is what to ask.



The very essence of enjoyment is play,

So if you're getting stuck, don't stay.

Find a lighter, looser, lovelier way.



Would you prefer to be right or get results,

Or be the one with whom everyone consults

Or to be blessed with the steadiest pulse?



Remember when it gets tough,

That playfulness can be enough:

Laughter is a form of income.



All you can do is what you can do.

As for the rest, it is not up to you,

So decide what you want to be true.



What you really need to understand

Is that giving your heart and hand

Also means giving up all demands.



Going without knowing the way

Is daring to invest, not just save;

It is the very definition of brave.



Not everyone can relate to you -

And that needs to be alright too:

It will be better with just a few.



Everyone else will be able to relate to you

When you tell not what you went through

But what made you decide to start anew.



In giving others something to share,

It is what you choose and from where

That helps them to grow more aware.



If you don't, then no one else will

Share with the same love and skill

(This is not your time to sit still).



Wherever silence hides a fear

The greatest healer is the ear

That listens until all is clear.



No need to glare at what you want to change

But you must craft perfection in your brain

So your subconscious can see where to aim.



Along with patience have a plan

That includes everything it can -

Where to takeoff, fly and land.



There's not one thing you do that's small:

You pass unlit lanterns along a night wall

And your torch brings light to them all.



Some circular stories never go away,

They just turn slower every new day

Until they are a statue of yesterday.



As long as you're trying to get somewhere

You'll meet people with things to compare;

Be right here - all that's left to do is share.



This body is your perfect vehicle

To journey all that's meaningful

And experience the unbelievable.



Do any of them seem happier than you

Living the way you dream to live too?

Examine every detail, not just a few.



What you dream of is just a direction -

Go that way, but keep asking questions.

So you reach not a place, but the lesson.



The answer you're looking for is this:

You talk when you're just interested.

When you're serious, you schedule it.



Frustration weeds up the empty space

Wherever commitment isn't yet laid;

Hands in dirt is how a garden's made.



You don't know what you're getting into

When you begin. You're just not meant to.

So look for the questions, and hints too.



That was a tunnel that you passed through.

Crowded or twisted, that one's behind you.

Forget about that now and enjoy this view.



There is a whole other way to look at this,

One that rearranges the way everything fits

And puts you in a position to gain from it.



It only seems they took advantage of you,

That is, in fact, very far from the truth:

You freely gave - the thief was the fool.



How it is isn't worth complaining about,

Spend one full hour mapping another route

And then pack your gear and then set out.



What you love to hold, you sometimes drop.

When you do, it is just as important to stop

To see if you made a mess you need to mop.



Pick up after yourself

As a matter of health,

And proof of wealth.



What do you expect is in store?

Do you need there to be more?

Who are you doing all this for?



Forgive all those sellers of cheap things

Pressuring you to buy what they bring 

Unaware you already have everything.



That you are so responsible in

Tending to what's meaningful

Is nothing short of wonderful.



Right now, what are your priorities?

When we look into each one of these

Which ones stir both drive and ease?



If you think a thought then feel tension,

Slow down at once and pay close attention

To what's trying to avoid being mentioned.



The journey is going as it should:

Everything is not always all good,

But more is becoming understood.



You will soar once you let yourself plummet.

Study the stories of people who have done it -

Gone into the unknown to launch far above it.



Those who speak from a state of alarm

Spread a conversational form of harm;

Refresh the room with wit and charm.



What they offer, examine closely.

Do they also live it, even mostly?

Are they the guest to be hosting?



Start that next piece before this one is done

And if your mind keeps asking for a reason:

Nothing can finish until after you've begun.



Hold those fears in two closed hands

And let them escape as grains of sand

Each too small to make any demands.



Looking to what any given day can bring

Is tending to the wind and not the wing

Put your health before any daily thing.



Be up to meet the day head on, 

Or work the whole night long -

Do whichever sings your song.



Splitting your time between here and there

Actually puts you in the middle of nowhere.

Do it if you must, but change it if you care.



Just listen whether they rant or rave.

Develop your own new way to behave,

One that considers acceptance brave.



You must allow them to deny,

You must even allow the lie,

You must allow their why.



Control isn't why you're here. 

Events are not yours to steer.

Be light and open and clear.



They will keep unloading hurt

Like a full truck dumping dirt,

Until the moment you self-assert.



They are allowed to hold up their own truth,

They are even allowed to consider you a fool;

But you must continue to choose. So choose.



Feel it in full, but don't spread it around,

The emotion that pulls all that's light down;

Quarantine it - let the rest of you rebound.



It's as simple to say as this:

"What once did, no longer fits."

Everything changes. Everything shifts.



As you're now finishing,

Here's to new beginnings!

By starting you are winning.



Listen to what is being offered -

Is it being said to sound proper?

Is it from a real doer or a talker?



Your very approach forces them to react;

Check what can be perceived as an attack

And get yourself to take a few steps back.



Hold longer and wiser conversations:

You'll need less time for preparation

By using the power of collaboration.



When they ask you for the story

Be sure to cover every category

As if they were an actual jury.



More people than is evident

Truly do appreciate silence;

Give it and see what you get.



Which creativity comes when alone?

Which creativity comes from home?

Which creativity comes on its own?



Know when to bring in other opinions,

Feel when to make your own decisions,

Sense when it is the time for division.



Check they know what they're talking about,

That they understand their work in and out,

And begin with mind, then end with mouth.



There is more wisdom than you can imagine.

You have experienced just a mere fraction;

The rest needs more discussion to happen.



Your body is an extremely obedient servant,

Following your mental example in earnest -

So think good thoughts as if it were urgent.



Things are headed right where they're going.

You get the privilege to witness life flowing,

And to see firsthand how useless is knowing.



Let them tell you it's unbelievable

As your knowing defies the physical

And creates completely new material.



No one knows what they're talking about

Except for the inner voice with no mouth.

Listen so well you become deaf to all doubt.



You do the same thing they do,

Thus it annoys you to the root;

Make peace with the inner fool.



Hear your default inner monologue.

Is it describing a journey or a slog?

Exactly who is bringing who along?



Can you see how you've repeated enough?

Do you see there's no more to gain from

Continuing with no point to speak of?



Center your focus on your intended goal

And you won't need to fight for control;

What must will just slowly, quietly go.



Whatever your age, seek out an elder,

A time-tested mentor, a genuine helper

To build you an experience-based shelter.



You are the villain and they fight for glory

What if they deeply need this as their story?

Are you here to play out their flat allegory?



You are not here for idle chitchat -

But to go where today's truth is at:

Be the listener - not the diplomat.



Dismantling doubt takes much more time

Than moving forward in one straight line

Be original later - for now, just rhyme.



When you put your hand over your throat,

It symbolizes you have something to choke

Which is important, so take special note.



When you put your hand over your core,

It means you're guarding against more.

Of what? Answering is your next chore.



Which words do you use in a conversation?

Are they ones that are used for persuasion

Or that acknowledge your inner location?



It is never too early nor too late

To build something that resonates:

Someone somewhere sincerely waits.



The mindset of training is a crippling one,

That swears something else must be done

Though you already shine like the sun.



As long as you keep believing reasons,

This will take you many more seasons.

Why not decide more delay is treason?



In case you were seeking an outside verdict,

No one ever needed your need to be certain:

You're most beautiful when you're imperfect.



Whenever you become perplexed,

Whoever comes over to you next,

Whatever in you do they reflect?



As soon as you're no longer chasing,

And have had enough of past-erasing,

You and true peace will be embracing.



The kind of preparation you favor

Isn't what you need now or later -

Build a space for you as Creator.



Let doubt have its chance to say

What it's sure is down this way,

Nod and come back out to play.



To make the next transition

And get beyond idly wishing,

Simply change your position.



Though it feels like pointless abuse,

What feels hardest to put to good use

Is a box holding transformative truth.



Once you cease seeing you as your habits,

The easier it gets to feel and then have it:

You can already just reach out and grab it.



The second you feel misaligned,

Or like an accomplice to a crime,

Give them no more of your time.



Signs simply wait to be read.

You're speeding by one again.

Rely on the eyes of a friend.



If you get stuck in the circle of thought

For far longer than you realize or ought,

Take one bold leap and out you will pop!



If you see that you've come back here again,

And as for returning, don't remember when,

Breathe in fresh knowing, to a count of ten.



If you feel uncertain where to go again

Or cannot begin to decide exactly when,

Breathe this mind out to a count of ten.



If they prefer to talk,

They're already caught:

You hurry up and walk.



Being able to sense a disguise

Is part of becoming this wise;

Do you also see what's inside?



Don't be the one to fill that space.

Don't rush to answer. Let them wait.

You're to be patient and contemplate.



The events that can't be undone

Teach you a personalized lesson:

You get to choose what to become.



You will never get enough -

You will only have enough -

Once you decide, "Enough."



Forget what you've been reading -

The kind of day you're completing

Is what decides what to be eating.



It is absolutely all about your attitude:

Great health comes from a great mood,

So let laughter spill into every room.



Once you start genuinely expressing,

What feels like a public undressing,

Is stripping away second-guessing.



You think you know. You surely do not.

Experience is a trap. Do not get caught.

Leave behind whatever you've brought.



See for yourself - not through a filter

And immediately spot what's off-kilter

Between what's new and what's familiar.



The part of you that wants to hide

Is sitting on what's deeper inside:

Dig just past it to your gold mine.



Feel free to listen well to everyone's advice,

But find the only one worth hearing twice -

The one that is as powerful as it is precise.



Thank the one who never hid -

The one who'd catch you if you slid,

The one who caught you last time you did.



Once you've given all you've got

You will arrive at the very spot

Where you can receive a lot.



It's time to journey upstream -

To the source of your mystery

To your answer's beginning.



Whenever you feel things go off-course,

Think your way right back to the source:

Make sure there is more flow than force.



Open up a little bit more of your attention

To take in all the beauty in every direction

And feel how it immediately cures tension.



You should now be asserting yourself

Via firm handshake or wishing well;

Make an impression that is heartfelt.



Don't do it because you perceive a need,

But do it because of where it could lead:

Do it because it plants one amazing seed.



The reason there needs to be a lull

Is not to give you time to grow dull,

But to let you regroup to be invincible.



There are things you still need to know,

Waiting around that corner in the road.

Let this be reason enough for you to go.



If you can practice a patient passion,

There are lessons you cannot imagine

On the way to what you will be having.



If what you're told contradicts

Something you just feel within,

You're not what needs to be fixed.



As if you're winning a bet,

Laugh in the face of fret -

Because you're not done yet.



There is nothing you can do

Except what you came here to:

Let that pass right on through.



Being angry enough to fight

Doesn't make you or it right;

Your grip on this is too tight.



When you want to just curl up

And admit you have had enough,

Remember your most loving hug.



When you want to just turn around

Or sit right here on the ground,

Allow yourself to be found.



When you want to stand up and run

In order to get everything all done,

Forget about the many for the one.



When you want everything to stop

To give you more time to gear up,

Tell this feeling, "That's enough."



There are so many ways to get there

That you can take any. But beware -

Halfway is the quickest to nowhere.



The story you tell has to be shorter;

Arrange everything in the proper order

And you will have yet another supporter.



Most of them won't matter at all, 

But one key detail is invaluable -

The one that feels least repeatable.



Exciting times are nearly upon you,

Not because of anything you'll do, 

But because of what comes through.



As you keep at it every single day,

Heading into your own made up fray,

Time will surrender, bow down and pay.



What feels like the definition of mad -

Pursuing something no one's ever had,

Is how you'll stay fulfilled... and glad.



Listen so closely, not for guidance,

But to find your next great alliance

Or who deserves your full defiance.



Why are they here now? Who knows!

Your job is to be the one who grows

No matter what the forecast shows.



A lot of people expect you to -

Should that decide what you do?

Be as quick to say hello as adieu.



You need to say that's enough,

That this road is plenty rough

Without hotheads flaring up.



The ones who feel like long lost friends

Are the ones you can trust, tell and send

Or ask to hear you out again and again.



If you won't listen to praise directly,

You're blocking things from connecting;

Gratitude is all about being accepting.



Very soon it will be bigger than you

And that is just plain, simple truth

As long as you keep yourself in tune.



Accidentally saying what's impossible

Sheds light on something meaningful -

That limits are absolutely reversible.



What you make will be greater than its parts

If you give it the best, earliest, farthest start;

All you'll ever need are momentum and heart.



You don't have to like their decision,

But it's their life and their vision,

So you should move to avoid collision.



It's not true, despite all the debate:

They hold opinions they didn't create

So don't judge, just avoid and wait.



Don't respond to every knock at your door

Or else distraction will demand even more

And invite confusion to make visits galore.



Have you thought it all the way through?

Is there someone you owe for being you?

Is something outside of you more true?



You do not need to be any smarter

Nor do you need to work any harder,

You just need to walk a bit farther.



Without completely knowing

You just have to keep going:

Your map is still unrolling.



Though the end is out of sight,

Do the rest with all your might

So your foundation is airtight.



First, do it all the way,

Heading on into the fray,

Willing - come what may.



Luck runs away from the idle.

Be just like a horse unbridled

Then it cannot escape or hide.



Do your part of the work,

And if your helpers shirk,

Let this teach, not hurt.



Do all you can before luck arrives

And you'll discover it in disguise

Right here in front of your eyes.



Wisdom will not come from what others say -

Mistakes make experience, it's the only way;

Failing is nothing more than a price to pay.



Every day unearths another nugget,

More gold to drop into your bucket

So dig where the ground is rugged.



Learn all of it for yourself

So that even if darkness fell

You could generate new wealth.



Be cautious and bold,

Hearing what is told,

Taking your own road.



It's wise to learn from those who fail,

But beware those who repeatedly flail;

Ask about the direction of their sail.



Certain causes produce certain effects

So you already know what happens next

Just looking at what to what connects.



Go and get the best tools,

Learn all the basic rules,

Excel in your own school.



What is worthwhile takes effort -

Not reading a book by each letter,

But dedicating to growing better.



You have barely reached halfway,

So now that it's half underway,

You can do things more your way.



As heart cannot be mind,

Giving must not be blind:

Leave cluelessness behind.



Don't seek more where you last lost.

Pay no more than what it already cost.

Consider this a border you've crossed.



You uplift everything around you.

The effects are tangible and true.

Knowing this, what will you do?



Think long-term but act right now.

Long-term thinking shapes your how

And uses your lifetime as its plow.



Do you keep wishing you'd already begun,

And then wish you were now already done?

Forget about the distance and just run.



There is a point to pushing through it.

Delay gratification and get back to it -

Find your original reason and renew it.



Know your target. Know yourself.

Rely on certainty - not on stealth.

No need to aim far. Just aim well.



You can be doing it right now

Even without yet knowing how

Once you completely allow.



Those are just the actual tasks.

Find those who can help, and ask.

Be visionary. Let others be fast.



What you assume is well-meaning

Is preventing you from varying:

Be willing to change everything.



Make your own decision,

Uphold your own vision

And by each be driven.



Be owner - not boss.

Study gain - not loss.

Look in - not across.



Hard work is pointless labor

Until your reason is greater,

And then the impact is major.



Your morning rituals are critical,

And when you see just how pivotal,

They become your secret miracle.



Finish the ones now growing old

And start adding some newer goals

So the rest of you can yet unfold.



Channel your passion.

Take immediate action.

Note: Put off satisfaction.



Organize tomorrow today -

Next week, the same way;

Unschedule all disarray.



Break it down into daily tasks.

Then do each one and do it fast

And the worst part will be past.



We all possess the same powers -

We all own the same 24 hours;

We all build tombs or towers.



Visualize to properly use your brain

Because what you imagine, you ingrain

And what you think is how you train.



Become a student of history

And what they call a mystery

Will reveal itself swiftly.



To help others to self-attune

Create more than you consume.

If you need time, make room.



What are you waiting for?

Someone to give you more?

What have you already stored?



You have to start with nothing

To understand this one thing:

You are what you're becoming.



Have nothing to do with it;

Being given is the opposite

Of getting via will and grit.



Energy goes where it finds its match:

What gets caught with what can catch.

What will your unique energy attract?



Of course you know how to protect,

But open up the gates and connect

With all the villagers you affect.



The basement is full - go upstairs.

Enjoy the view and the fresher air.

Everyone knows, but few go there.



Where is your backup plan based?

What would you do, just in case?

Are these thoughts you ever face? 



Is it too advanced for right now?

Is it an idea that dares the how?

For present reality does it allow?



Help those who help themselves

For the complaining it dispels

And the momentum it compels.



Give real things - not words

Because water quenches thirst

More than asking if it hurts.



Are you focused on your main endeavor?

Is it ready for every kind of weather?

Over the seasons is it getting better?



Constant hammering on one nail

Will certainly and without fail

Drive it like a train on a rail.



Be systematic - think about the steps.

Rearrange in your head what comes next.

Play until you are all done with stress.



Don't be too systematic - let it flow.

Just forget about where this might go.

Could any flower forget how to grow?



Know what's really happening. Find out

Because when you know what it's about,

Your light shines through the clouds.



If you don't like the way it sounds,

Perhaps they overstepped their bounds.

Do they stand on justifiable ground?



Why not be novel, if you have the choice?

And you always do, because of your voice;

Uniqueness is something you cannot avoid.



Check to make sure that is the truth.

If it is not, detour from this route.

If it is, tell other traveling groups.



Honesty. Mislead for no one.

Untruths shrivel in the sun;

Clarity blooms for everyone.



Expand your concept of personal joy

Beyond collections of physical toys

Into what even time cannot destroy.



What any experience will mean

All depends on your philosophy

So why not use one that's lean?



Whatever story appears to be rising

Is something all of you were writing

To act out together. Come out of hiding. 



The way they keep sabotaging your actions -

They are obviously well-timed distractions

You laid for You on the way to satisfaction.



You will save yourself so much trouble

By closing off into an imaginary bubble

With all of history's sages in a huddle.



Move in a way that is proud, but not hostile

For emotions gather up inside your posture;

Move like someone who expects to prosper.



It's about more than just who can pay -

It's about if you like to work their way

And love hearing their voices every day.



Note how quickly you respond

To decide if you want to go on

Or say it's already too far gone.



There's no telling when it will end, so

Regardless of comfort zones or trends,

Adjust, accommodate, stretch and bend.



This time, yes, you need to vent

Both for all that it will prevent

And for the release it represents.



You be the one to break the ice.

But instead of trying to be nice,

Just be intentional and concise.



They don't have to have what you need -

You have to be able to quickly perceive

To know if they do, then stay or leave.



Temper is the most accurate indicator

Of what you already put off until later

And has grown into something greater.



Are you being deeply heard,

Deeper than the actual words?

Answer this question first.



You neither need them to agree

Nor be pointlessly provoking;

You need them to let you be.



When you do need to let it out,

Find who knows what you're about

And only then open your mouth.



No need to refuse out of spite, 

But if they wasted your advice

How will they treat your time?



Draw closer to those whose presence sparks

Something in the very center of your heart

And the nights will never again be as dark.



Though you may still pause for tears,

There simply is no time left for fear -

Your once far-off dream's nearly here.



You can say yes, just to find out

What their offering is all about:

What is true in what they tout?



Is there any more you can do?

There is. You know it's true.

Hunt down your next excuse.



Doubt lore, legends and such.

Search until patterns turn up:

It was by law and not by luck.



Look at everything from above:

No one succeeds from just luck,

Nothing long-lasting is rushed.



On what legs will it all stand?

Do you have an organized plan?

Study as many others as you can.



Do you want them to ignore their thirst?

To them, whose discomfort feels worst?

Have you helped them ease theirs first?



Helping is going to be your universal key

To get started and done with everything:

So first of all, go give what others need.



Are you spending enough

Time tilting your chin up

And expressing self-love?



Whether or not you feel recognized,

Keep working. You may not realize

The work is changing you inside.



Slow down - it is your earnestness

That brings out all your very best,

And draws wisdom out of patience.



Regardless of intention, the effect was what?

To deliver you a solution or leave you stuck?

You need better alliances - not better luck.



They don't know:

You must go slow

So you can grow.



There is too much to get done right now

For you to be constantly reinventing how;

Only constant daily execution is allowed.



Asking to find out why

Is one of the clear signs:

Trust your own insight.



Until it is scheduled, it cannot become real

No matter how intensely or certain you feel;

Committing time gives your wagon wheels.



There was no path from which to stray,

No charted route to sail through today

Because you are both wayfinder and way.



You will overcome the insurmountable

By holding only yourself accountable;

Draw upon what feels most bountiful.



Your evolution can happen overnight,

Or it can be a long, drawn-out fight;

Either way, it is going to be alright.



Do you worry that you'll sound too weird?

Or that you are precisely what they feared?

Head straight - your way has been cleared.



The conversation hasn't happened just yet,

Even though everything else has been set -

So go in seeing your needs as already met.



Negativity isn't anything more than help

To nudge you out of that yesterday's self,

Butterfly, asleep in your caterpillar shell.



Lay your habits as carefully as bricks

Because once time gets each to stick, 

They will withstand even direct hits.



Let the outcome go either way.

If it matters, you'll be led astray;

Always benefit, come what may.



Fine, call this your obsession - 

But see what else must get done

To give more to your intention.



Enjoy feeling this inner passion,

But make sure the tasks get done

To fulfill your external mission.



Doing a thing to get a thing is suspect.

Doing a thing to be that thing is correct.

Doing must be kept in constant check.



You possess more strength than you realize,

More healing power than a hospital inside,

More wealth than could ever be monetized.



It is not about some one thing you do -

It's about your honesty coming through

By putting aside your how for your who.



That you should do more is just a concept.

Compelling, yes. But as a point, incorrect.

What should a mirror "do" but reflect?



There is no need to be combative -

What you are here to do is forgive.

Put down your shield and truly live.



What you have is not who you are.

Where you go brings you near, not far:

Use your center as your guiding star.



Be grateful for having made it here,

For being able to lend a genuine ear,

For recognizing those who are sincere.



All of your options are actually vibrations

Each amplifies or silences other creations;

Choose what sounds and feels like flotation.



Trust your ears even more than your eyes

And you will soon be pleasantly surprised

At how easy it is to know things' insides.



Being reliable is pulling you under.

Change is what gives your life color.

For this reason alone, try the other.



Regardless of the effort you exert,

Not everything you do will work.

Listen to feedback and stay alert.



Plant your stake here in the ground.

Whether you rest, climb on or hike down,

Mark it and look all the way around.



Don't bother deciding who you'll become.

Think about how much you want to have fun

And give this your life's days, one by one.



You are here not to flee, but to chase,

But not like running a planned-out race;

You are here to catch up to open space.



Some say to speed up - others, to slow down.

Techniques and options will always abound.

Your ideal pace keeps no feet on the ground.



The point of the story is not to lay laws,

But to give you some time to just pause

And maybe rewrite your own "because."



Let failure make the ego weaker,

Turn you into a softer creature -

Awaken your most selfless seeker.



When you're on either side of that feud,

Whether called "hero" or not, you lose

Unless and until you do as you choose.



Too much certainty leads to confusion;

You have to work on constant evolution

To become a fountain of new solutions.



They don't understand what you're becoming

But do understand when you speak of money;

Be mindful of this in all that you're running.



Right now your role is to fully support,

Not to investigate, criticize or resort -

Any other approach will only fall short.



You can reach this place by intuition

Or smack into it via direct collision;

Either way delivers you to transition.



There is more of you you can call upon.

Go to the mirror, take time, look long.

It's there in your eyes: endless beyond.



You've reached the end of standing still.

Once you get moving your momentum will

Either learn or lease any required skill.



Ones who won't finish fret about the start

But you're going all the way, so take heart

That you will no matter what comes apart.



No one else gets to use your voice.

No one else gets to make this choice.

No one else gets to have your poise.



Let someone else be busy talking about it -

Because narrators eventually tire and quit.

Be the one who works at the center of this.



Whether visibly or just inwardly churning,

Is something in you sitting there squirming?

Consciously forgetting is your new learning.



You were just there - in your natural state -

In the place that you neither rush nor wait,

And where you are neither small nor great.



Today whether you feel bored or excited,

Realize the feeling was somehow invited;

You are the host, so say, "How delighted."



That is a place you need to escape.

Get out. Don't return. Do not wait.

Some things are nothing to leave to fate.



All of your dealings need to make sense,

Ask that they clarify just what they meant.

All throughout this you should feel content.



Treasure those who hear your intention.

Treasure those who pay close attention.

Treasure those who are your reflection.



Let your expectations die away lovingly.

Let it be enough to exchange the energy.

Let renewed senses transmit and receive.



Just reach out toward that direction

And begin to sense their intention:

You know beyond what's mentioned.



They may or may not keep goal journals,

They may or may not have leaped hurdles,

They only need to honor your inner circle.



So many things don't need doing,

So many facts don't need proving;

So much feeling goes into choosing.



It will not matter in the long run.

What will matter is that you had fun.

Can you do this before you get done?



This is a time to bear down and tackle

This problem that so many has baffled.

Between both worlds you must straddle.



Sitting underneath a cascade of stories

You'll be showered in pains and glories;

Dry off and explore other territories.



Rather than feeling the need to worry,

It will make more sense to just hurry

And finish it all in a fantastic flurry.



There isn't time - at least not much,

So get rid of random things and such

And every hour give yourself a nudge.



Right now you indeed need to hurry up

Whether that means a push or a shove,

Finish it faster than you dreamed of.



The time to slow down is not today.

Today get everyone out of your way.

Weigh each obligation as one delay.



The finish is close. Dive for it. Leap!

To reach out and grab what you seek

Let everyone else choose to be meek.



Everything you do affects something else,

But rather than hiding inside your shell,

Acknowledge this and use everything well.



Whatever you end up deciding to do

You should conscientiously choose -

And this will also shift your mood.



Why you pick the things you do

Is as important as how you do.

Yes, why not always improve?



What is given as a gift is meant for you

Whether or not you can put it to good use

It is a chance to exercise your gratitude.



This time you know just where to search -

Exactly where you thought to look first.

Trust your instinct as if it were thirst.



Don't go down that road. Stay on this one.

It is better-maintained and gets more sun,

Which helps whether you walk, jog or run.



The joy of having a long-term vision

Is that without the approval of anyone

You'll slip into a life-giving rhythm.



It's time you come to understand that

Where you are going is not on a map -

It's a state that no longer looks back.



Routine will pull both shoulders in.

You pull right back and you will win;

Likewise, gravity cannot beat a grin.



Some of your routines, never ever lose -

Other ones it is time to pick and choose.

Some pretend to go, but it's just a ruse.



How you see the exact same thing

Determines how every day begins,

So make a ritual of perceiving.



Choose to have a plan for the day or

Get pushed and pulled every which way.

Priorities will tell you what to say.



What's most important, tackle first.

Realize if it were hunger or thirst,

Not doing so would soon be worse.



Can you just be in this present season,

Some days unpleasant, some pleasing?

Allow timing to have its own reasons.



While looking for a way to approach it,

Stop to consider if you've even noticed

Whether your eyes are actually open.



Overwhelming? Yes. So just ride on top:

Floating amidst it all - unable to drop;

It can't crush you when used as a prop.



How would you need to be? So become that

Even if it requires you to wear many hats

Until you learn how to be where you're at.



When they say it is too complicated,

Listen with a great deal of patience.

You did the work - they just waited.



It's wonderful to be a self-starter,

But refusing help makes it harder

Than flowing together like water.



It feels wrong to behold suffering.

You feel you ought to be buffering;

Bearing witness is what you bring.



Life is locked and something holds the key?

Did you really come to solve some mystery?

Trust that you already know what is to be.



Are they involved in teaching or in sales?

Do they come to you as either head or tail?

Do they hand you your hammer and nails?



Is the purpose behind their story

To make you feel extraordinary?

Is contentment just too boring?



The problem is that story has no end.

It just ropes you in again and again.

You're born free but you decide when.



Regardless of the surface layers,

Your experience surpasses theirs:

Don't be unruly, be keenly aware.



What use is another assignment?

Yet one more bit of confinement?

Finishing tasks versus alignment?



This avalanche of assignments

Might make others feel tense -

But let it awaken deeper sense.



Whoever claims they've things to teach,

Do they know what you desire to reach?

Is there proof of what they can unleash?



Despite what the resentful are whining,

The greatest impact is all about timing:

Keep your eyes, ears and arms aligning.



Let everyone else stay at the festival -

For you, let that be incomprehensible

As you train to become your best of all.



The schedule you'll have to keep

Would make your past-self weep;

There will be a time for sleep.



Trust that an end will arrive.

Your purpose now is to thrive.

Own every bit of being alive.



Because weather is not always kind,

Build this with the winter in mind:

What can be bound, be sure to bind.



Yes, you deserve a moment of pride,

Manifesting all of this from inside;

Now shore up against the downside.



Before you hear the howling of the wind

Is when your stormproofing must begin;

It is the time to build things, not listen.



There are times for taking risks,

And then times for making shifts.

You already know which this is.



No need to begrudge the road behind you,

But do tighten any wheels that came loose;

Out of everything try to get the most use.



Study the sources offering you advice:

Do they need you to see them as right?

Is their delivery honest or overly nice?



To finally decide on what you should do,

Rather than start to look anywhere new,

Think your way up to the clearest view.



It becomes pointless to remain on guard,

Because the answer was never that hard:

Step out of your own mind's backyard.



Who can say what happens next?

Does uncertainty call for stress?

The unknown knows what's best.



Hopefully you have not forgotten this:

You can learn more from your opposite

Than you can from what just won't fit.



Whether or not you feel on the verge,

Sooner or later the truth will emerge

With more spontaneity than an urge.



Sometimes your preference is irrelevant.

Sometimes you're the branch to be bent.

Sometimes you're the message to be sent.



You handled it well, whether you realize yet.

You were so natural, with no agendas preset -

This is the best way to live free from regret.



And so what is a lifetime of experience worth

If a deep sense of purpose doesn't come first?

A refreshing drink is useless without thirst.



Step outside and invite others to join in

So that something truly great can begin:

The start of a many-member expedition.



You took loving care of your initial vision

And now it is time to share what was given;

Entrust it to those who adore your mission.



There is a life patiently waiting for you,

Waiting for you to live this one truth -

That it is time to entrust others to do.



Your vision is stuck behind your beliefs.

Other people can provide you with relief,

Offering to be your extra hands and feet.



This is not the time or place for focus.

It is the time to find space to be open

To make sense of all that's unfolded.



They need you to rush. Instead, wait.

You may see more if you just hesitate

Or at least take time to contemplate.



Though this was not a part of your plan,

It doesn't mean that you can't. You can.

Goals, like water should flow, not stand.



Don't have to live fearing the worst,

But why not put certain things first?

Peace of mind takes such little work.



We are each misled by what we recall,

And yet who of us will let go of it all?

You'll be the first to shed and evolve.



If your thinking gets stuck on survival

You'll get stuck awaiting life's arrival.

Instead grow a group that feels tribal.



Knowing just what you want is marvelous,

But if it turns you more and more serious,

Start over with what can keep you curious.



Ask until you find what intrigues you most.

Question as if you're the most curious host

Wanting to hear everything you can be told.



The best of things will fit perfectly

And build all around what was already

So you can grow stronger by leveraging.



Time is not something you can earn,

Nor can you make time pass or burn;

So time should not be your concern.



Dive into your overall attitudes and beliefs.

Do they hope for the best, assume increase?

Do they learn from what pleases you least?



What was unwanted is the gift,

For all that what's unwanted shifts,

Forcing expectation to give in.



So much can be said in one single glance

That one moment holds enough chances

To behold all the deeper circumstances.



Next, stop all that inner speaking -

Listen to all that they were feeling.

All that being wise is, is receiving.



Clear the space. Empty it out. 

Let it sit (don't move about).

Being Here... is being devout.



The numbers will either grow or shrink

Without telling you about a deeper link

Between how to live and how you think.



It is time to embrace You and share.

Trust it and lay your own soul bare.

You are so perfectly incredibly rare.



Reach a sense of where is your limit -

Of what you can give and then give it;

This is how you meet with your spirit.



Ask people about what they know

And they will both tell and show

You new ways to think and grow.



Let this day's predictable be rejected.

Let advice come from the unexpected.

Let everyone's offerings be respected.



Asking why is like stirring a pot of soup

Trying to get just one ingredient loose;

Asking what lets the pot serve you food.



When has worry led to anything amazing?

Yes, fear can fuel your faster trailblazing,

But you'll be fastest when you're chasing.



It wasn't meant to make your anger burn,

It was meant to make you set your terms

And be simultaneously honest and firm.



Yes, your instinct is perfectly right.

The time has indeed come to fight:

Battle your resistance with insight.



Not doing is not actually learning -

It is but fountain water, churning;

A stream learns the way by turning.



Mind what you let your thoughts think

Because of how all those thoughts link;

Not all water is meant for you to drink.



When you find yourself on guard

Over tasks that feel overly large,

It comes time for you to recharge.



Some will tell you not to be so nice,

Which is some short-sighted advice.

Put people first. Don't think twice.



Their advice might sound too abrasive,

Yet be worthwhile once you do face it.

It's given. You decide when it's taken.



Some old friends will just fade from view

As you continue heading somewhere new;

Those who come along are a priceless few.



Don't just treat it any way you wish,

Or else you may end up its next dish,

Taunting a shark while being a fish.



The poem of partners doesn't need rhyme,

All it needs is space between each line.

A partnership's best part is free time.



The way ahead's job is not to be clear -

The way ahead's job is to show you fear

Was a way that is neither now nor here.



What is all this mess? Find your way back

To getting things organized and on track.

Finish the disarray with a surprise attack.



Where there is space, things rush to fill,

And do so again and again, right up until

It's cleared with intention backed by will.



But this time they see more than you can,

The entire horizon and not just the land.

Beside them for awhile is where to stand.



Put your whole trust in that biggest dream

Regardless of how impossible it may seem;

Above all the vision, and then the scheme.



Whatever you choose as your intended goal,

If it can be new, will soon enough grow old;

Being with feeling springs forth joys untold.



Allowing yourself to become overextended

Builds, leaving your foundation untended;

Only commit when time-leaks are mended.



You do not help by sacrificing yourself

Any more than dying helps your health:

Shining brightly lights the way to well.



Rearrange your life in better order

And there'll be more time to afford

To spend on those you truly adore.



Clean your space until it feels spacious,

Not so you can appear neat or gracious,

But so you can find your work's basis.



Go numb to all the phenomena

That come and are then gone;

Feel for what goes on and on.



Put one hand on your heart

So the other one can start

Then each can do its part.



You're likely upset over the wrong thing,

Like ignoring music while trying to sing;

Useful anger harmonizes but doesn't cling.



Regardless of you feeling inconsistent,

It is time for you to be an instrument.

There is something you now represent.



Better decisions ask for better questions

About matters not normally mentioned;

Honesty will help set the best intention.



You do not have to do this forever. 

You only have to stop saying never.

You only have to be true, not clever.



Some will do things hoping not to hurt.

Others do things hoping to finish first.

You should do what has lifelong worth.



Who would you be happiest to see again?

Here they are! This is not play pretend,

Rather a bit of your awareness to mend.



People speak the language they are taught

So in confusing phrases, don't get caught;

Keep on translating only what you ought.



Though the proposal might sound absurd,

Stay mindful of your every chosen word:

How you respond is what gets overheard.



Those you're happiest to see again return

Not for any extra love they hope to earn,

But because you don't just glow, you burn.



There's little you do someone else can't.

It's how you do it that forever enchants:

Everyone here loves to watch you dance.



It's not about getting more things done.

It's about making time between each one

To notice what each helps you become.



If you look around and see a mess,

It means your routine is in distress

And needs you to do one thing less.



Yes, there is a path that is perfect,

But a different way is also correct.

Figure out which one is most direct.



You don't have to know ahead of time,

But once you do, it will feel sublime

And you'll write your own next line.



Some conversations wander in the dark,

Others become an inspirational spark.

Give the next conversation your heart.



Make yourself a double promise:

That you will get through this

And your moves will be swift.



Water can run without being pursued.

Wait for the vision to come find you.

Be the riverbed. Let it flow through.



It will be better to focus on quality

Of a kind you can touch, hear and see

So you can live deep within integrity.



Be in it from a place of stillness.

Set your own time and noise limits.

Live a longer-lasting fulfillment.



Doing a thing to get something back,

Forgets how to live love that attracts:

Get your material priorities on track.



Travel in an unplanned direction.

Make a new, unlikely connection.

Express what you rarely mention.



Listen up for words that sit you down

Moments after you meet their sound:

They will be your new high ground.



Take heart - it is coming soon,

Bigger than any monetary boon.

All you have to do is make room.



Sometimes you have to put yourself last -

Because sometimes help has to come fast.

Sometimes you have to bear all the tasks.



Of methods and systems be hesitant.

Of your heart and soul be reverent.

What your wellness needs is evident.



Keep your mission fresh by sitting down,

Not by checking in with everyone around,

But by being here with what you've found.



Keep on coming back to yourself

Regardless of how you once felt:

This is about your whole health.



You have known what it is to be in pain.

You give help when others feel the same.

For this, people are speaking your name.



Take the road that leads to more roads. 

Take the way about which less is known.

Take the journey taking you from home.



You are so close - you just need to stop.

Tear up your blueprints and entire plot.

The genius of chance is what you've got.



As often as you admit you do not know,

You will give answers one place to flow

And prove there is nothing to control.



It's so important to keep making plans.

Whether they take you to distant lands,

Or just take your heart to your hands. 



Regardless of your feeling ready,

Shed, shed and keep on shedding.

Let the peeling away be unending.



Here is all that has to happen -

You have to have some attraction

To whatever calls you to action.



Being here is not about work -

Nor avoiding or relieving hurt:

It's about giving spiritual birth.



Allow everyone the same room for mistakes.

Allow everyone room so it is never too late.

Allow everyone room to do something great.



You told your truth, there's no more to it.

They'll have to decide how they'll use it.

Your only job is to just keep being fluid.



Clarity can end up coming soon

If you take time to make room,

Which seals confusion's tomb.



One odd thing about intensity -

It can trigger spiritual density.

Why not retire this propensity?



Your thoughts are getting very complex -

You're getting your own lightness vexed:

Your heart wants what's simple and fresh.



No one has come this way yet;

That alone makes you the best

One to know what comes next.



The more time you spend trying to explain,

The more questions will come just the same.

Work on your masterpiece - not on its name.



Look deep into the core of what you do,

Right into the very essence of its value.

What could put more of this into view?



Yes, your mind can find you plenty.

There will just always be too many.

So if you can't do all, don't do any.



Look at what is standing right there.

Examine it all with painstaking care.

What can you use - how and where?



You were loving to give of your time.

Now lovingly say, "The rest is mine,"

Out of respect for your peace of mind.



That wasn't forward - it was a wider loop;

Enough reinvention. It's time to execute,

To trust in your process and be resolute.



There is no straight line,

Except the passage of time

To help clarify and refine.



You need to keep heading this same way

For what you'll get to hear yourself say

As you find better ways to do each day.



Your tone tends to turn its harshest

Where your inner night is darkest;

Let your dawn light up this forest.



Rather than judge where you see a mess,

You should stop and investigate instead

To find what turned neatness on its head.



Getting back on track is going to take work,

Daily moving in the direction of what hurts,

Daily putting sure and organized effort first.



People are set to keep doing as they choose;

What's up to you is whether you'll win or lose

Based on their goals or doing what's in you.



If you're conflicted about involving money,

Maybe it's because your sky is already sunny

And anything but sharing just feels funny.



Back then, it could be chaos and confetti.

Now your pace should be slow and steady,

So that even when rushed, you are ready.



You are not to blame - you are responsible -

And this makes you so much more powerful

As you realize something truly meaningful.



If you press too hard, you'll lose feeling

And then it will all become less appealing;

Have a process so thin that it's revealing.



Why does it have to be wrapped so tight?

Does this symbolize a desire to be right?

Loosen: discover both meanings of light.



Look at your hands - the work they've done:

How they've tirelessly served for everyone.

They probably deserve a little bit more fun.



If you make your hands work too hard,

They'll start to put up their own guard;

You get more done by using your heart.



The energy you put in can be rough or easy:

The first kind is stormy - the other, breezy.

Would you rather travel fiercely or freely?



Sometimes you actually have to ask,

Whether or not you deem it your task

Because others are depending on that.



Though you may still want to astound,

Eventually part of you gets worn down,

A way of saying, "Stop. Turn around."



You may still think you need to strive

To make sure your vision stays alive:

Honest love is all it needs to thrive.



Whether you succeed on a global scale,

Or thank the lessons of a genuine fail,

A journey's only worth what it entails.



Open up, lean back, look up and extend.

Stretch out past every limit's very end,

And past whoever wants to know when.



And here is all you need to know:

This is your life - not some show.

Slowly is the surest way to grow.



Advice that is not worth what you paid

Actually is - for the impression it made.

Continue to listen without being swayed.



The way to have something to give

Is to decide on a great way to live

That cares for the You you're in. 



Just as travel doesn't have to mean walking,

Opening doors doesn't have to take knocking:

Manifesting doesn't have to involve talking.



Keep chipping away at it, yes, every day.

Chop what must go from what can stay.

Great sculptures wait for you this way.



Be mindful not to believe in the mind.

You have access to senses of every kind

To be someone who new light can find.



When life sounds louder than your own voice,

There is an unspoken benefit to all the noise -

Something in you whispers, "Practice poise."



It is only about this one step,

Whether it is a right or a left,

It is this move, not the next.



It is unsettling and yet true -

What's in them is also in you.

You will lead the way through.



When your roots feel stretched thin,

Maybe it's because the patch you're in

Will be the forest your tree begins.



One way to look at your workload is this:

Is it something you'd help someone with?

Then you too, deserve some help with it.



You absolutely have to speak up for yourself,

For your time, but most of all, your health;

Only you can know you down to your cells.



For now, you should be creating in solitude

To work through every sort of creative mood

Until you discover your own creative groove.



This way that you are treating yourself,

Is this how you would treat anyone else?

Do you believe kindness creates health?



You have been doing this for so long,

That even the tiny details are strong,

Thanks to what you put your focus on.



Talking and talking and talking it through

Will likely start to shake something loose

That has attached itself but serves no use.



To connect around discussing problems

Might not actually help you solve them:

Spend your time discussing knowledge.



It angers you because of what it triggers,

Not because it points out anything bigger:

What you need to do is to disarm quicker.



It is time to get your mind clear,

Not by listening to everything here,

But by muting what's between each ear.



You'll have more to offer if you come back

After time away, because distance attracts

Things well beyond this one single track.



Put it all out there as one body of work.

Put away plans for nexts, lasts and firsts.

Put in the effort until you're immersed.



As long as you keep going back to the start,

You'll keep making it harder for your heart

To express itself and take your story apart.



It can take some time to change direction -

To see where you are and make a correction,

So be patient as you do some introspection.



This loving act may feel the opposite,

Because of the friends attached to it -

But you know that it is time to quit.



You no longer have time for conversations

That involve useless, unkind speculation.

Your time belongs to your re-education.



You can love them, yet still let them go

Because one of you needs space to grow:

This is perhaps the bravest love to show.



They talk in circles and you must move on.

Your silence is saying it's time to be gone,

Starting your journey while it's still dawn.



You do not need to be keeping close track,

But do realize when you're being set back

By the ones who have that uncanny knack.



Overcoming negativity is a noble pursuit,

But you can do far more. That's the truth.

Courageously imagine. Lovingly produce.



Just keep working and little by little,

By putting yourself right in the middle,

You will strengthen what was brittle.



Listen closely or long enough to hear it:

That warning not to go anywhere near it

Because you cannot stop, start or steer it.



Have they given themselves enough time

To hear your request and properly align?

Decide before things get too intertwined.



That is why you're in this position:

To get your heart to share a vision,

And your mind to make a decision.



While it is not an absolute must

To feel you have immediate trust,

If you feel the opposite, adjust.



Your instinct is rarely wrong -

Though proof might take long.

But depend on it. It is strong.



You can get caught up giving answers

And lose yourself in a fog of banter.

Silence can act just like a lantern.



Giving something a chance, doesn't guarantee

Everything will fall into place uneventfully.

Yet whatever you decide, say it respectfully.



Things haven't come together? What to do!

Tell it like it is, or dance around the truth?

Talk how you would prefer to be spoken to.



What works, works and what doesn't, doesn't.

"Should" and "did" are quite distant cousins.

Your decision won't need much discussion.



If you have to manage it to that degree,

Then maybe it's best to just let it be -

You can't be tending that constantly.



Some things just don't align.

It wasn't just the right time.

It just wasn't the right time.



Maybe later you can look at it again.

For now, it needs to come to an end.

Right now, if you're not sure when.



There are so many moving parts.

Nonetheless, you have to start.

Details do not faze your heart.



As you go on, it might get messy.

Nonetheless, it is a great blessing

To be doing, rather than guessing.



Thinking about what people say

Wastes what remains of the day:

Think as if let out of some cage.



What they can do is what they can do.

It may not be what you need them to.

Make a decision once you have proof.



Just like flowers, people can grow,

The same way any seed can be sown -

With care given and patience shown.



Invite people, not to change,

But to find their best range;

This is how you both gain.



If you keep on coming back as you like,

It will keep bringing you back to &lsquo;might.&rsquo;

No. Head to the farthest thing in sight.



There is no one, single, ideal way;

There is only your intention today,

Which may be best to write, not say.



If there is a parade behind you, let it play.

So long as it does not start to lead the way.

Behind, never ahead, is the place for praise.



Getting to where you need to be

Won't show what you want to see,

It tells what your actions mean.



You're allowed to bite into moods

The same way you can try new foods,

So mind what you feed your attitude.



Should you go get it or wait for it to come?

Either way, first see to it that this is done:

Make room precisely where there is none.



At times the journey will feel mystical,

And at other times unbearably difficult.

That you just keep on going is critical.



Your peace will come from being flexible -

In your body, your mind and your schedule.

Gradually shed all but your own key rituals.



If you say this is the last time,

You'd better be ready to be fine

With crossing a different line.



If you say this is the last time,

Do you say it with your mind?

Or are the words of a soul kind?



If you want this to be your last time,

Learn all you can, empty your mind,

Then see if you call either "mine."



Empty space tends to get filled,

Unless its owner becomes skilled

At fending off outsiders' will.



As many memories as you hold dear,

Keep just as much mind space clear

To hold all there is to take in here.



Almost as soon as you set up a standard,

That one request will become a demand.

But keep your mind on the task at hand.



Take longer breaks between each action

To review what brings you satisfaction

And revisit what causes which reaction.



Just because they haven't given truth,

That does not invite you to do so too:

It shows you words are toys or tools.



You heard them say "It's impossible,"

And in response held an inner festival

Already knowing you'd be best of all.



If you're not pleased with your performance,

Take on habits that build up your endurance,

Which also serves as the best life insurance.



You learn something when you procrastinate -

Time can be ordered to serve you in haste.

Can you leverage this without being late?



You have this knowing in your bones,

That good ones have colorful tones -

So mix some and enjoy others alone.



This is how you know it's your calling:

When there is no hesitation or stalling

Or interest in rest, even when yawning.



When it does not feel worth the price,

Something from beyond your daily life

Is trying to speak to you from inside.



In less time than it takes to blink,

Certain tones trigger your instinct:

Do what you can to objectively think.



Make sure it still feels like play.

If not, find a more intriguing way.

Allow your mind to drift and stray.



You should start to see some benefit

From working near those you're with,

Otherwise you should start to quit.



This is the time to just keep going,

Not to speed up or think of slowing,

But to trust without fully knowing.



Though that gave a good reason to fuss,

Grow numb to such cyclical stimulus -

Endure it to do exactly what you must.



Life is already getting better.

You've outlasted the weather.

Everything has come together.



Don't wait for an invitation to arise.

This is your opportunity in disguise -

Being first is better than being wise.



Next, get up every single day,

And do it the same exact way,

Until you can knowingly say.



If it comes apart after awhile

Or can go in and out of style,

Toss it out and onto the pile.



However many times it takes,

To revisit it this same way,

Be patient enough to stay.



There's not much left to talk about -

Give them space to protest and pout.

Stay inwardly still. Throw them out.



Those who encourage you to go back

Could put your schedule off track,

But detach from the urge to react.



You won't always use the right words.

Some you choose unintentionally hurt.

Forgive yourself - but apologize first.



Consider their invitation to vent,

As more like a one-way argument.

How else could your time be spent?



Regarding those you cannot possibly please,

Understand they have an infectious disease:

Build your immunity by thinking of ease.



Disappointment delivers a wrapped gift;

That before it will enlighten or uplift,

Will patiently wait for you to open it.



Whatever you focus on multiplies,

And whatever you ignore subsides,

So decide what to show your eyes.



Look at what's smiling back at you.

Look at its beauty as physical proof:

Look at how love is looking at you.



Look at what's stewing in front of you.

Look at its intricacy as energetic proof:

Look at this as an exact opposite route.



That wasn't the way you prefer to hear it,

But could it have been made any clearer?

You are not the doer - you're the hearer.



Bear witness as confusion unfolds.

Be patient hearing what's all told,

Tend toward neither hot nor cold.



Feel back to all those bound-up thoughts.

Most were simply what you'd been taught.

To feel today, cut all those frayed knots.



You are not here to cling or to clutch.

You are not to archive details and such.

Today, you are to be exactly this much.



Being free means you are able to be open.

So allow love to bubble into this notion,

That you've only seen a bit of your ocean.



Let it feel exactly as it does.

Go neither below it nor above.

Keep on flooding it with love.



Lovingly allow what's behind you to be.

There is no need to turn back or to see.

Let it fade. Let every bit of it go free.



You're here now to experience surprise,

To experience disbelieving your eyes -

To feel more inexperienced than wise.



Although no two need be the same,

Your decisions are links in a chain:

Make ones that outlast the strain.



Start budgeting either money or time

And the other will immediately align

As your accounting continues to refine.



Until the lesson feels like your own skin,

And likewise protects what's vital within,

You may have to do this again and again.



Yes, there will always be more to learn,

And higher levels of this to be earned;

For what does your heart truly yearn?



When you get the chance, ask all you can.

Let your imagination in their place stand.

Let their experience help refine your plan.



Let an alternative appeal to you instead.

Let all those rules be broken if not bent.

Let your inner answer be, "It depends."



Put yourself in the right place as well.

This lessens the need for you to sell 

And allows your story itself to tell.



How much easier when you have more help.

How much easier when you welcome wealth.

How much easier when you position yourself.



We all say things we immediately regret,

So channel that feeling inside to instead

Forgive others for all that they have said.



Some will make you want to turn away,

But face them and close attention pay

To find a kind thing left you can say.



It can be a tone or an overall manner,

Bearing down like a banging hammer:

It is a loud call to raise your standard.



You are the only one in your way:

Simply hear some of what you say.

Change your language this very day.



No need for some breakthrough:

No one blocks your way but you.

Step aside and let love through.



Do you desire to be seen or to observe?

Are you looking to receive or to serve?

Must something be given in return?



If there are conditions, love is held ransom,

Which can offer less in the way of expansion,

Which is not something to take a chance on.



Judging the steps you have taken

As the right ones or as mistaken

Is trying to sleep - not awaken.



Ordeals that brought you here from there

Everyone would agree were far from fair,

Yet without them you would be where?



The best way would be to have your own

So no one could make you feel you owe,

But sometimes you have to need to grow.



Sometimes it won't work independently.

Sometimes the lesson is to be in need -

To truly know how vulnerability feels.



Problems are a sign of growth. 

Mastery is growth grown old.

Take the journey of unknowns.



Be mindful of the urge to relax.

It can lead too far to get back,

And there you'll be - off track.



The reason to be mindful of comfort?

You may forget what you've come for.

The uncomfortable become triumphant.



You know the number you need to reach

Before you can be an example or teach.

Until you get there, count on belief. 



You can see it on involved people's faces,

An inner glow that reflects engagement:

Make yourself useful in fulfilling places.



You can live as perfectly as you like,

And remain unfulfilled on the inside,

So seek to grow gratitude, not pride.



Imagine if instead of feeling needed

You were far more heard than heeded;

Would this have more or less appeal?



Can you allow others to be used

As you just give them the tools?

This is the best path to choose.



Consider each word an energetic marker:

When words seem to be getting harsher,

Perhaps you need an earlier departure.



Not knowing how things will play out,

Sharpen the focus on what you're about

And then more good things will sprout.



Each choice takes time and precision, so

Make the decision to not make decisions

Unless they relate to what you envision.



Who can say how things will go?

You already know: no one knows.

You can only choose to grow.



Your current feeling can be ignored.

Uncertainty can still move forward.

You can be unsure yet still perform.



You get a certain number every day

Of focused decisions you can make;

Don't waste them on what can wait.



The day is full of decisions to make,

So creating habits will help automate

Ones that shouldn't be left to fate.



They're not going your way,

So let the things they say

Become part of yesterday.



As long as you don't get too attached,

You will stay nimble enough to attract

The perfectly timed and placed contact.



The lesson is that when in a game,

If your opponents' remain the same,

You win when your tactics change.



One of the best ways to offer help

Is to take amazing care of yourself

To show what goes into being well.



Everything is here for you to interpret

In whichever way that you feel works.

Try: what's the hidden lesson of hurt?



Is it a thankless task or mindful work?

Either - wherever your focus goes most.

So take the time to train that to turn.



"Stop changing your mind. Stay the same."

This advice is how to turn creativity plain.

Innovation lets itself be considered insane.



You belong where more things are happening,

Where ideas and people each come traveling,

Where tomorrow's innovators are practicing.



You've worked on your own long enough.

It's a testament to you you didn't give up.

Now it's time to come and meet everyone.



Your place must be closer to the action -

Not for money, fame or even satisfaction -

But for the removal of every distraction.



A big part of momentum is removal

Of influences that can never be useful

As you discover your spirit's approval.



If it should trigger any reaction,

Let it be your deepest compassion

For whatever caused that to happen.



Not that it's about going and going

Or just being still and all-knowing:

It is about what's in you unfolding.



Find mentors to learn what's not obvious,

Things that can't be seen by the audience:

How the pursuit itself is what's glorious.



Are you shying away from the center?

Let this be your momentary mentor:

We go where we are ready to enter.



Follow those who are on the move.

Notice how they live in a groove.

Put your whole being to full use.



However long it takes, so be it,

For you to open up and free it,

For you to let the world see it.



You're marvelous and yet not enough.

You need help from below and above

To accomplish all that must be done.



Go where there is an active vibration

And leave where you smell stagnation -

That's all you need. Oh, and patience.



Don't think of it as some big decision.

No, think of it as a gradual transition

Toward you, and away from tradition.



Including today's mood too,

How is your overall attitude?

Should you refresh or renew?



Going it alone can feel more productive.

That is a misconception most seductive.

Collaborate. Others can be instructive.



As you come to the close of a chapter,

See if you caught what you were after

And discovered a treasure of laughter.



You don't have to like each one,

Perhaps not even most of them -

But at least you will have begun.



Your instincts are telling you correctly:

Yes, you should address it, and directly.

(Self-trust will soon feel elementary.)



You could accomplish this all by yourself

But it is time to learn to be open to help

That can make this go better than well.



You can learn volumes by listening closely

To the topics people don't mention, mostly,

And going deaf to what is said boastfully.



If you need to yell to be heard,

When it's calm, you'll sound absurd:

Go where they hear your words.



Backstories eventually get forgotten,

Or at least not fully retold very often.

Your fresh presence turns them rotten.



Their worries take over their ears

And warp everything they might hear;

Be gentle where they have most fear.



It is time for you to face it:

You need to get back to basics

And review your social graces.



Everyone is unique in a different way so

Forgive and forget with no bit of delay;

Sun, let each of them be to you, a Ray.



There are two ways to go about this:

Wait until you have to make a shift,

Or be mindfully proactive about it.



Time for you to leave this place,

To compete in that bigger race,

To look your Power in its face.



Figure out what they're looking for,

Then figure out if just a little more

Would get them to shout, "Encore!"



Some use conversation as a form of attack,

To battle your ear for what it is they lack.

In situations like this, pull listening back.



When it's time, everything gets left behind

So practice right now within your own mind

By letting some defining memories unbind.



The habit of how you talk to someone

Certainly cannot overnight be undone,

So try things day by day - one by one.



Words meant purely in jest

May instead arrive to test

A relationship needing rest.



The greatest gift you give is space,

When letting others speak their case

Or letting them know you will wait.



Observe the temptation to be demanding

Or onto someone else blame be handing.

Be at peace with not yet understanding.



There's ease in keeping things the same,

But this is the opposite of why you came:

Change, for change's sake, again and again.



It is more important to keep things fresh

Than it is to think about your own success

As long as you feel some sense of progress.



How will you know it is time to move on?

When that daily unpredictability is gone.

You need to keep moving to stay strong.



Who are all your efforts designed to serve?

Who's immediately affected by your work?

Rather, who reaps the benefits of it first?



So redefine what it could mean to retire.

For some, it is a way to permanently hide.

For you, let it be a way to rest for awhile.



Stop that, so you can start doing this.

Doing things in order has its benefits.

What comes next should be what best fits.



Beware unending trips to life's shops.

No one will tell you it's time to stop.

Decide what to buy and what to not.



Tomorrow's decisions are easier today,

If you can see far enough down the way

Or ask those who went but didn't stay.



If it can't work easily, what's the use?

Too complicated and it will just confuse.

You need to review, rethink and then redo.



You may disagree your way was rough,

But their feedback should be enough

To prove you should shed some stuff.



It may not match with your perspective,

But instead of playing detail-detective,

Why not take the time to be reflective?



When we're embarrassed, we deny -

Which is a nearly-convincing lie;

Give honest embarrassment a try.



You've told yourself it's part of you,

And so it would be detrimental to lose.

However, not one bit of that is true.



On the other side of that behavior

Is what you could deal with later,

Or handle before it gets weightier.



What caused that inconvenience?

Was it a lack of self-obedience?

Or the need for a little lenience?



Admitting what's wrong can feel worse

Than continuing to bottle up the hurt,

But recovery usually feels bad first.



Look at what's actually there,

Not the fog that fills the air,

But at what has been prepared.



Determine its genuine value.

Get good at it. You have to:

Soon others will ask you.



Find out what is actually at stake

For those with whom you'd partake.

What does each hope to cultivate?



There is something deeper going on,

Something you need to put focus on,

Before you stay here too long.



What's really going on eludes you

Until you decide to know the truth

By deciding to see right through.



There's how they describe it,

And there's how it really is:

From which do you benefit?



What are they selling - and to whom?

Find this out or your time is doomed

To whatever they schedule, and soon.



Once you understand their game,

You can choose whether to remain

Or find a different one to play.



Those who benefit - do you know how?

Past what they say, does proof abound?

If so, great - if not, get yourself out.



Make sure your work is wisely invested

Not into what's just casually suggested

But into concepts that are time-tested.



It is important to know what's underneath

Before any more of your time you bequeath:

Dig until your understanding is complete.



Think of it as if you're building a chain,

Either the kind that holds and maintains,

Or the kind that pulls incredible weight.



Whether you find wrong turns unamusing,

Or laugh all throughout winning or losing,

Either way, keep doing what you're doing.



Your creation should never ask for change

From those who need that to stay the same.

Do this for those who also have your aim.



By seeing opportunity in bad weather,

You bring the farthest parts together

And create something beyond measure.



Stretch your thinking to encompass it all

And raindrops of ideas will start to fall,

Becoming a brainstorm almost by default.



The purpose of a price is to share value,

To invite others to participate with you

Offering tribute to the cost of pursuit.



When you flinch at the price,

You're looking in from outside:

The amount is a measure of time.



Expecting to be given a discount,

Rather than paying the full amount,

Is a gift that will come back around.



You are beautiful, despite denying so,

But be mindful - denial is detrimental.

Admitting your beauty is meaningful.



Beyond stopping by to greet it,

Caring means you have to feed it

As often as nourishment is needed.



Those addicted to information

Lose themselves in observation.

Find yourself lost in creation.



There is more to you than you could know.

This how you can ignore what today shows.

This is why what matters now is your flow.



Ones like you are a beacon

And people truly need them

Along their way to freedom.



You are beautiful before you try -

A beauty even clear to closed eyes,

A beauty that has already arrived.



Love is what makes you beautiful,

Love for yourself and for us all,

Love that is wholly irrefutable.



Give yourself completely over

To wanting to get even closer

To what brings more exposure.



Whatever brings you more exposure

Also brings you that much closer

To the path that is more overt.



An intention that is this enormous

And so vibrant it's also gorgeous,

Deserves an accompanying chorus.



A community has chosen to encircle

What you set up and it's wonderful,

Because this support is so durable.



Whether you're inclined to cheer aloud,

You should take one moment to be proud

Of everything your vision has endowed.



Making a new one may break two old,

But take it lightly if someone scolds.

Keep causing more things to unfold.



Keep on refining your questions

To ease or lessen people's tension

Over what they're about to mention.



What you are doing is building a base,

Not for a short stay or a just-in-case,

But for protecting one critical place.



Your arrival has been especially important

To so many voices that have lain dormant,

Awaiting you, to get beautifully recorded.



The sun will shine again, even brighter.

Days are already getting a little lighter.

You can be the lover, retire the fighter.



No matter the damage, keep rebuilding.

Perhaps more windows, higher ceilings?

This is flourishing, not just healing.



With this fuller idea of who you are,

You will see the path ahead quite far

With the help of some familiar stars.



It will be so rare to find an example.

When you do, you'll know if it's ample

By how much it builds or dismantles.



Some spend a lifetime waiting for them

Only to realize right near the very end,

Leaving would've led to better friends.



Pack light. Set out. Just start traveling.

Staying put, things will start unraveling.

What lies ahead is nothing short of dazzling.



You will feel like you're being left behind,

But that is not what should be on your mind:

You are at work on becoming one of a kind.



Even though you may feel devalued,

Let the crowd move on without you:

You have more that you're up to.



You need to let them pass you by

Because you're headed far outside

The realm that they came to find.



Now more than ever aim your focus

Away from patterns you want broken

And onto the path you have chosen.



Dedication can look incredibly boring

Against having countless fans adoring:

Only one gives you the gift of enduring.



You're going to have to make a sacrifice

That some will say is paying the price:

It is the decision to live your own life.



You are coming into your own.

That is why you feel so alone.

You're nearing your new home.



You're getting closer to catching up

To loads and loads and loads of love

From everywhere you could dream of.



Before the dawn it will get dark,

So use the light within your heart

If you need to make an early start.



No, the teller told you a lie.

Those rules never did apply.

You were already right.



Keep trying, but not to please anyone.

Keep trying until the sunlight is done.

Keep trying because You are the One.



It will hurt so much you won't want to go on.

But the journey's the only place you belong,

And the journey is what will make you strong.



Traveling gets old and you will get tired,

But this is how you gather wood for fire -

By moving in and out of the forest entire.



Be open to all the voices that are speaking

Whether they are the ones you were seeking;

You're rich to be so bountifully receiving.



The words may sound worse than what's true

Or they may hide what's being kept from you.

Regardless, you have one option: to continue.



Forward no matter what. Tell yourself again.

Forget about how far until you reach the end.

Decide you will go, with or without friends.



When you feel yourself drifting inside,

Momentum is all that will save your mind

And your deadlines from falling behind.



This is the time to gather up speed and try

Before the opening is no longer this wide.

Swiftness is necessary at this exact time.



This time it isn't the relaxed expedition.

Whoever stops moving on this one stiffens.

Continue to look, leap and always listen.



You were invited to this grand exposition

Not given a ticket for general admission,

But sought out to be the perfect addition.



Two lines of loved ones flank your arrival,

On one, those who guaranteed your survival,

On the other, those who loved you as rivals.



Thoughts and work are a small part.

The biggest piece of all is your heart.

With it, whatever you do will be art.



Looking like you expect more to happen

Is an expression you can get trapped in:

What's the face of peace versus passion?



Word has spread - you are being requested

By everyone who had previously objected,

And by new benefactors yet to be invested.



The impact of your work is growing now

It's happening - don't worry about how.

Work, improve, work more... and allow.



Since you are doing it for deeper benefits,

You represent more than yourself with this

And must be mindful which partnerships fit.



Because everything has its cycle,

This cannot be forced or stifled:

That you understand so is vital.



A slump is not to be avoided - 

But how your cycle is pointed

So nothingness can be enjoyed.



Just in case you refused to accept

Lessons that were meant to be kept,

A refresher course is coming next.



Building back up from where you were

Means you'll have to set up new terms:

Who gets ignored and who gets heard?



Let others waste time peddling appeal;

Offer people what you know to be real

And they will pay in ways you can feel.



That chapter has long since ended;

Parts of it have already fermented.

Take fresh ones that are presented.



Make certain necessary sacrifices

To steer things away from a crisis

It will be hard, but be decisive.



If it feels like all has come apart,

This is where your new life starts.

Consult with no one but your heart.



Building a foundation is thankless

But each and every bit of anguish

Makes you impossible to vanquish.



Usually when you think you've lost it all,

Something else happens to prove you wrong:

Giving thanks will always keep you strong.



One hand builds while the other battles -

Right now, that's just where things are at,

So stay fully aware of each effort's status.



Would you have agreed if you'd known?

And that is why you were only shown

Enough for this to begin to be grown.



You've worked so hard, with no "reward,"

But what you've gained, many yearn for:

You've been able to do what you adore.



Dedication merely clears the way:

Structure is what ensures you stay

Right in the heart of the interplay.



The level of choices you have to make

Keeps rising with each risk you take,

So be aware of how much is at stake.



The real problem is always perspective -

Never the details - just ask any detective:

Doubt all your hunches and be objective.



You are allowed to build a prison of rage.

You are also allowed to pry open that cage.

You are also allowed to be an everyday sage.



If you would do what you enjoy for free,

Then why not for everyone simultaneously?

Expand your concept of how far you reach.



Hiding in shadows as their survival habit,

Scavengers find what they can and grab it

Far from the brightness that you inhabit.



Deeply honor the power of each link

To raise the very way that you think

And to ensure what's sediment sinks.



The power of your efforts is magnified

When you make a bridge from the inside

To whatever in your world is most alive.



The true power of each thought

Was not in doing what it ought,

But in what all else it brought.



The power of your internal connections

Creates these outside-world reflections

So look around you in all directions.



Whether you realize it or not,

This is exactly what you want:

You can decide what to drop.



When you hear people complain about time,

How they're managing theirs isn't right,

So do the opposite and more you'll find.



Though this kind of treatment you detest,

Imagine they're giving you their very best

And when they improve, will give the rest.



It's all about how you interpret -

That decides what all comes next,

So take care of your own mindset.



Clues and signs are all around you.

If at first they just confound you,

Use them in a way that grounds you.



When things go not as you intended,

Ignore the signals from your senses

And go follow where this is headed.



Whatever wanted you to feel justified,

Probably doesn't even realize it lied

By dividing the whole up into sides.



Acknowledging everyone you meet today

Is like lighting torches along the way

Just by having something warm to say.



If you thought it otherwise, you mistook:

As it was in all that you ever undertook,

Help is everywhere you're open to look.



The child in you is what is wonderful,

Curing seriousness by being whimsical.

Let more out because it's truly magical.



Why are you this upset?

This irked, this vexed?

Give love to this next.



They are only doing what you chose to see

Demonstrated outside of you - externally -

Because you want to look at this thoroughly.



Good conversation holds a loving sensation.

A great conversation births transformation.

So talk with more people who love creation.



Reacting is tossing a pebble onto a pond -

Once you do it, your reflection is gone

And the ripples are what become strong.



When you slip up, Life will tease

By snatching away the joy of ease,

Until you organize and say please.



Certain mistakes can cost you much more

Than anything you could have planned for

So prevent them with organization galore.



Though talking can get so intriguing,

You are here for more than a meeting:

Find out what you can be completing.



Regardless of meeting your own goal,

By making your learned lessons known

You'll make everyone who hears whole.



You are vital to us all, regardless -

Whether you pursue external success

Or choose to remain here and bless.



Prestige rarely welcomes change, so

Be wary of talk that's full of names.

Keep your words strong and plain.



Sometimes knowing, you use less sense.

A little ignorance is sometimes best.

Give your mind and your mouth a rest.



Leave for later the reason it's broken;

For now, just leave the whole thing open

While you find the best place to go in.



Wanting them to come to you is futile.

First you need to make yourself useful

By finding out what to them is crucial.



Have you been told before?

You don't need to do more:

Your delivery opens doors.



Give them all an unforgettable treat:

Remember the names of those you meet

Because this is not a one-way street.



Deciding to stay here was not wrong.

You'll be glad you didn't go along:

You've learned a new way to respond.



There's a perfection to the new results coming

Even a wild imagination would find stunning.

And you won't need to be one bit of cunning.



What came before helps you produce

Just as buds bloom thanks to roots;

You will be something's basis too.



Beware of those who say no all day long.

They do not mean to turn your day wrong,

But you need skill to bring them along.



Connection is an added benefit,

But that is not why you did this:

Stay close to what inspired it.



History is not for the rummaging.

Future is not for the plundering.

A good life shares the wondering.



Intensity feels fine for awhile,

But soon enough goes out of style.

Try out something that runs mild.



As soon as you shed that thought,

Whatever you tell to stop will halt

And over obstacles you will vault.



The whole thing has to go like this:

Even if it happens to be inaccurate,

You keep trying until something fits.



Instead of being the main one to bellow,

This may be the perfect time to mellow

And become known for your serene hello.



Your efforts had a time and a place

That have at this point been replaced

By something you cannot rush: Grace.



Grant someone something unforgettable -

Without any occasion particularly special

Sincerely tell someone they are beautiful.



As the sun begins to set on all you've done,

Will it matter whether or not you ever won?

No, it never has or will. Just enjoy everyone. 



With or without training to speak of,

Develop a voice that makes you sit up,

That sounds like an instrument of love.



Darkness is good for narrowing your sight

So you can undeniably recognize the light

From what seemed dim. Now how bright!



We're born, we grow, we bloom, we go.

For exactly how long, no being knows.

Time aside, we all came here to glow.



"Almost there" means you're still measuring,

Thinking about what pleasure getting brings.

How much could you already be treasuring?



There is always some room if you adjust

And realize there is nothing you "must,"

And so much more when you bravely trust.



Beauty is about having something to say,

Not necessarily with words or every day,

But an energy that beams like a sun ray.



Even though it seems set,

Wait, for this is not it yet.

On that, you can safely bet.



Whenever you get stuck in the middle,

It's harder to saw, easier to whittle.

It's easier to do it little by little.



If "variety is the spice of life,"

Coincidence is delicious delight.

Fill your day's dish with surprise.



First figure out what can be gained

By keeping things exactly the same

Versus spearheading massive change.



To keep getting what you currently get,

Yesterday's effort would be appropriate,

But today calls for an energetic reset.



When serendipity speaks, truly listen,

Not to the empty echoes of superstition,

But to the voice guiding your mission.



Now taking a moment to let your layers peel,

Something known yet new has been revealed:

It all revolves around how you choose to feel.



It's as useful to go where it's easy

As it is where you might feel queasy:

We learn whether or not it's appealing.



Take some time to reestablish order,

To review and redefine your borders,

To remind yourself you are important.



Create the boundaries for the space.

Cultivate what will then take place.

Clear all that should be thrown away.



Minding the details is important,

But only once you establish order,

So first get the overall sorted.



When someone shares your level of interest,

You can enjoy the feeling of being kindred

While both your spirits are being uplifted.



Doing something that to you feels pure

Sheds habits of which you're not sure

Leaving only ones that easily endure.



When you need to move through busy places

Rather than imagining yourself in an oasis,

Discover your paradise in friendly faces.



On being full we put too much emphasis.

What can be added to what is plenteous?

For there is no room without emptiness.



Do you pour your time into your will?

Or do you leave some for chance to fill?

Is there enough room to avoid a spill?



What would that have you become?

It's best to know before you've begun

By studying more experienced ones.



If it requires a skilled memory, 

Its importance is only temporary.

Instead master what's "ordinary."



Between knowing everything or everyone,

The first will get more and more done,

The last will grow more and more love.



It is good to grow different things,

For more than the variety it brings:

The change by itself is nourishing.



Listening to their list of excuses

Will put your mind to good use

Discerning weapons from tools.



Decide to do your best.

This must be stressed:

Yes - regardless - yes!



Doing the things you are supposed to do

Is the shortest path to reach your truth,

But it will still have its surprises, too.



Change is coming - it always does.

Not to harm you, but just because

You need a deeper lesson in love.



When flow has to twist around walls,

Somewhere there will be a waterfall.

Therefore, go slowly or not at all.



Before you rush to fix their problems,

Make sure they're real enough to solve

Before getting yourself fully involved.



Setting up a boundary is basically a fence,

If anything should touch it, you get tense:

Define yourself and move freely instead.



The big problem with asking why

Is that this might not be the time;

Let understanding naturally arise.



Until they break their cycle of depression,

Quarantine yourself from that connection

And disinfect all your internal questions.



This has nothing to do with being compliant:

If you think you know, then why not be quiet?

Either way, you might learn more when silent.



Rejection can make you feel vulnerable,

But you're wrong - it's nothing personal:

You're about to become more versatile.



It is a wise practice to plan far in advance

To make time to take more than one chance

And still accept life's invitation to dance.



How you allow yourself to be addressed

Is more important than can be expressed

Because it decides what you'll hear next.



Despite the fact that it may get botched,

Sometimes your job is to sit and watch:

Patience is all that should be topnotch.



You're overloaded. You're thinking to excess.

From another angle, see how you are blessed

To even have such reasons to get stressed.



At the time you did what seemed best, but

You've given so much there's nothing left!

For you, self-care is what must come next.



Whether or not you've finished your plan,

Surprises will meet you where you stand;

So handle them with heart, not with hand.



Even with both feet planted on the ground,

Your spirit can be felt, traveling all around

As you treasure all the people you've found.



When suffering is what you've been granted,

There's no point wishing to feel enchanted:

You'll have to bloom where you are planted.



If you dislike what you are being shown,

It is because everything here is unknown

And you just have to decide on your own.



Though you'll be tempted to react,

Do not interpret that as an attack -

Keep reading people, not contracts.



It is not about what they ought to do

In order to help see all this through:

It is about your intention being true.



Though it lets you feel some ease,

Hold on to it, but only so briefly;

It too, is little more than a story.



The choices will keep getting more granular,

As you recognize expectation as the saboteur

Because you're simply no longer an amateur.



What you are working toward will arrive

Along with a feeling one cannot describe

As anything except proof of what's inside.



Words swoop past with such agility,

But to soar you need predictability,

So surround yourself with stability.



As gardening must tend to the soil below,

Know when to say yes and when to say no.

To make success that much easier to grow.



Ignore what's happening. Schedule progress

Because you get to decide what comes next.

Dedicating time is in and of itself, success.



Make a habit of thanking your mistakes

For the hand-drawn pictures they create

Of certain patterns you underestimate.



On a scale you never dreamed to imagine,

In a way you could not begin to fathom,

The most incredible things just happen.



With everything, there are other levels,

So let the approach you take be gentle.

To ensure your options remain several.



Being told that you "should" or "must"

Should push you to the edge of disgust

Where you'll leap and fly via self-trust.



When you run out of hopeful things to say,

And feel certain you have now gone astray,

Intending to get there is actually the way.



Keep clearing the space you feel drawn to

Keep clearing away from it any other use.

Keep clearing the way until it's just true.



Don't mistake this as your new normal,

It is more like a massive door or portal,

That opens to a very different life order.



Whenever you let circumstances drive,

You reach twice as far in half the time,

So why do anything but be fully alive?



This time you have chosen to complicate

Rather than take the way that is straight.

If you cannot see it yet, you should wait.



It's fine to let excitement come.

You deserve the feeling. It's fun.

But there's still work to be done.



Regardless of which option you choose,

There is something within what you do

That invites an energy to flow through.



Think, but don't spend too long:

You may just as easily be wrong.

Head where feelings are strong.



Feelings may cause you to do worse

Than if you stood back from it first

To notice who is acting out of hurt.



Are you seeing how this cycles goes?

Who and what you genuinely know?

How and where your self-love grows?



It's not about checking off things on a list.

It's about being open enough for each shift

So life can keep on bringing you its gifts.



Old or new stories about enemies and allies

Are not even tales - they're all genuine lies,

Strange words that love does not recognize.



Seriousness isn't flexible, it's tight.

Sarcasm is a shadow - not the light.

Laugh in love and you'll be alright.



At some point, your feelings won't matter:

You'll simply lose interest in their patterns

Though you may still patiently have them.



Compared to them, your rise has been quick,

But it doesn't mean you're doing what fits.

Start getting better, not just better at this.



You may look back at the start of a trip,

But along the way, who you are shifts

Until today is the only thing that fits.



If you dislike paying this high price,

Realize that the price is exactly right

For the lesson all of this holds inside.



Like a shark who picks two fish to hunt,

Chasing two things, you only catch one:

You shouldn't be doing so much at once.



This new information that you've found -

Is in your hands - to pick up or put down

Based on whether it serves you right now.



You've done a lot quickly. Now slow down

To truly meet people and just look around

And feel all the power of common ground.



So it's not over before it ever begins, 

Forget about whether it loses or wins:

Can you make it feel lighter than this?



Old habits chose the thoughts you've had.

New thoughts can choose new habits to add,

Which should cut your time there in half.



You tried to be clear, which wasn't enough.

Your time needs more than a nurturing love;

Today it needs you to be stubborn and tough.



Being asked to do yet more can be flattering,

But your time is not paint to be splattering.

You have to return to what's truly mattering.



What draws a crowd hides behind noise.

Find a group that pauses for every voice,

Because listening is your bravest choice.



Of course "it could have been done better,"

But are rules to be followed to the letter?

It was raining, so you dared to get wetter.



Be unpredictable. Keep your responses fluid

So that whatever's up ahead, you adjust to it

And rather than obey a plan, naturally intuit.



Everyone else may say the answer is clear;

Let them go that way - you stay right here.

It is about living in a way that is sincere.



Kindness begins and ends with yourself,

For spiritual, mental and physical health.

This is the surest way for you to be well.



Does it feel strange to put yourself first?

Does it feel as if nothing could be worse?

Does it feel better to just stay and hurt?



Have you put something away for yourself?

If not, you should. You'll always do well

To keep a book of stories you rarely tell.



At this point, it may just be a whisper,

Because your body trusts you will listen

Without needing it shouted or written.



Your surroundings will limit your ideas

Until you decide to be extremely clear

About who you are and why you're here.



Unquestioned obstacles are the problem.

As people assume they cannot solve them.

Your own questioning needs to broaden.



If you've run before, you may run again,

Until it is time for your running to end,

Which only you decide where and when.



Stubbornness forgets, or else never knows

That it's just an actor in your mind's show

With too few lines for anyone to take note.



You should do it. You really should.

Not because it's for your own good -

But because if Love could, it would.



Today's hard, but keep the long view.

Look far down the road for the truth

Today's journey brings you closer to.



It is the habit you think least about

That turns your head north or south

And directs which words come out.



Your thoughts recreate what you see,

So you must put yourself accordingly

Where you find both effort and ease.



Trust that getting it won't do a thing;

You'll end up right back in that ring,

Until love is all you feel happening.



Working so hard is indeed shameful.

Doing so much is a form of betrayal:

You got here because you are playful.



There is such a gentle wisdom in small talk.

It invites you to take a seemingly short walk

That brings overthinking's march to a halt.



You did things that were ingredients for now

With no way back then to have any idea how:

Tomorrow already knows today turns around.



Your openness is what gives them permission

To tell of ideas that go far past idle wishing,

Finding their way just by having you listen.



Listen more closely than you have been.

So that you can more carefully examine

What they may be trying to have happen.



Sometimes people stink - we just do.

And once you figure out it's not you,

You can go around to sniff out who.



Places where people steal from one another

Remind you to get yourself out from under

Anyone who views generosity as a blunder.



What they took from you is so small.

Don't even bother to make that call.

Figure out what happened, that's all.



If it's going on like this, unresolved,

You have to get new people involved,

To show the old ones how to evolve.



More information isn't what's required -

You should rediscover what once inspired

By working until you are honestly tired.



Until you ask, you will have no idea

Whose perspective can make life clear

As you try to find a way out from here.



This time, you should keep quiet,

So saboteurs cannot come find it:

Be as busy as ever, but also silent.



Caution only makes more sense

When sitting atop an old fence.

Come down and openly express.



Sometimes your job is to observe,

Not prevent, intervene, or serve,

But to bear witness and to learn. 



They may not know what is at stake,

And you may have no time to explain.

Better wording may just have to wait.



From great guidance to bad examples,

Wisdom in every form you can handle

Is lighting your path's 10,000 candles.



First figure out if they're hearing you

Before starting to figure out what to do,

Or else you will be continuing the loop.



This is a lesson to learn once - and very well:

Where people must do things for themselves,

They need encouragement, not literal help.



Keep moving things around until they fit

(Alignment has everything to do with it).

You can stop when you feel peace within.



They will laugh so hard they may fall

When you keep your focus on the small,

Where it's easier to find humor in it all.



You are not the mindset you identify with,

Nor are you the habits to which you stick -

You are this essence that makes each shift.



The way you need to be thinking right now

Is a way that no one has taught you how -

A way that begins the moment you allow.



The amount of energy you have right now

Is not what yesterday limits or endowed:

It's how ever much you invite and allow.



Hear this: your beauty is in your limits -

So instead of seeking mentors to mimic,

Pay your precious vulnerabilities a visit.



Instead of unwaveringly wanting,

Question to the point of taunting,

Whatever is behind such longing.



You've done enough. That was the end.

If they come back to invite you again,

Show that on this, you will not bend.



It is time to change your tactics -

Yes, perhaps try something drastic,

Try anything except staying static.



You underestimate the dangers of staying,

And overestimate the ones still naysaying.

Get out there where creators are playing.



They're far now, yet still feel very dear,

Which is a reminder to focus right here

So you can both be heard as well as hear.



There's how you're choosing to see it unfold,

Then there's how others want this story told:

Neither is worth enough to be bought or sold.



Let deeds be forgotten and people forgiven,

As you hold on to this lived kind of wisdom.

Be loving, and patiently make your decision.



Some will do anything to save except spend,

Anything with what they have except lend -

But you will get back triple what you send.



Some place their attention on the pain,

While others look past that to the gain;

To your soul, you are you just the same.



There is a time when complaining must stop,

When the need for more evidence must drop,

When you take control - from bottom to top.



Just as a boat either sinks or it floats,

If it doesn't meet your needs, it won't:

In short, it may be better to go it alone.



Their imaginations don't need words to see

What you want to share and genuinely feel.

They need what is faced, lived, and real.



Sometimes the delivery has to stink

To get you to stop staring and blink

So you can reset yourself and think.



At this point, you're already halfway.

No one's opinion is welcome today -

Just get through all that's underway.



Before any of us walks well, we toddle.

(Bumpy paths can still make us hobble.)

On the way to balance, you will wobble.



Rushing makes it all seem and feel fake,

So use all the time that it needs to take

For yours, its, and everyone else's sake.



"Have you started?" "Aren't you done?"

If you do answer, you'll please no one -

Let your silence be respectfully blunt.



What you heard, you can't just un-hear,

But the words cease to reach your ear

When you start to be absolutely clear.



Parts of the journey will feel exciting,

Others will seem a little frightening;

What will help is to do some writing.



More important than having a plan

Is being tired of where you stand,

And trusting your own two hands.



The first try cannot be perfect.

But what can be is the attempt -

So focus only on each next step.



Here is what will happen once you start:

Your head gets guidance from your heart

And everything will play its proper part.



You won't get to decide what goes.

But by believing what you know,

Loss becomes a part of flow.



You never know how paths will reconnect,

So focus on now rather than what's next;

Cultivate feelings of love and respect.



Whether or not you feel as if you know how -

You need to lessen how much time you allow:

Meet everyone with who you are now.



Let go of repeating the same old cycle again:

Let the wanting-working-getting loop end -

Let you and what you enjoy become friends.



The feeling of being embarrassed

Is a feeling to truly be cherished:

It's the way to carefree awareness.



Put your whole entire focus into the start.

Put everything into the very simplest part.

Put everything forth that is in your heart.



In choosing which way to go forth,

Which hallways lead to which doors?

And which lead to how many more?



Your mind is so sure you need to act,

But it has not gotten all of the facts:

What you can do is take a step back.



Feel, feel, and then feel some more.

That is how feet move across a floor,

And how you get to what you adore.



Your greatest treasure is your time.

It is the only treasure you may find

By looking as far ahead as behind.



See questions and ideas as kinds of fuel,

Or as only-briefly sharp-enough tools

You know when and how long to use.



Advice is never as good as the giver:

Look within the one who delivers

For living wisdom that shimmers.



Take your time. There's nothing over there.

Rushing's the only thing of which to beware.

Slow down as if carrying something upstairs.



Learning has helped you feel qualified,

For everything except what waits inside;

For this, you need to trust and confide.



Kindness is one thing, different from trust:

The first is the way the second is discussed.

The second is a choice - the first is a must.



Breathe and release, or hold and collapse.

Throughout the day, carve out more gaps -

Times when your only answer is "Perhaps."



Well, you certainly have yourself a plateful.

And this is because you keep being grateful,

And each day keep becoming more graceful.



If you'll dare to use the simplest tools,

You'll help free others from rigid rules

And have a method you can always use.



All boundaries do is wait to be crossed

(owners of fences still get distraught).

Out past boundaries, get happily lost.



Definitions keep in, boundaries keep out.

Don't raise up a fence - build your house

By saying what is welcome inside aloud.



You already know this, yet still drift:

Self-care is not optional on your list.

It is the only way to unwrap this gift.



When you take their mood personally,

You miss what you are invited to see -

That everyone's on their own journey.



When you want to, you ignore what's rude.

When you want to, you replace your mood.

When you want to, you pass right through.



Limiting words create limiting beliefs.

Lighter words make lightness increase.

Words are for you to catch and release.



How you feel when you're at your best

Is exactly what it means to feel blessed,

Or to breathe more from belly than chest.



You're already saying how it will be,

So how about wording it differently?

Start using new words immediately.



Know what your energy flows from and to.

Also mind what your energy flows through,

Because that affects your effectiveness too.



The differences will, at first, seem slight:

One's a gentle landing, one a constant rise.

Why not choose to soar rather than glide?



You will want to be taking care of that now,

Before it gets in the way of tomorrow's how.

Who knows what else being ready will allow!



Not an issue about which to think twice:

Own your space. This is serious advice -

You're creating your version of paradise.



Let them build trust with you slowly.

This moment isn't your one nor only -

Take your time and proceed - slowly...



Slowing you down may be what they need,

But slow down at your own chosen speed.

You won't need to be moving to proceed.



Invite the energy that a new one brings.

Let your competition birth great things,

One collaboration gives ideas two wings.



Harmony stays silent when one voice sings,

But chimes in the moment that others ring,

So invite the challenge a new sound brings.



Though you feel broken, you are stronger.

Be brave and let this last a little bit longer.

Impatience is your only enemy to conquer.



Who says age is a measure of how reliant?

Let getting older be your license to be defiant

Of anything that needs you to be compliant.



What is the essence of what you talk about?

Because you grow whatever you speak aloud,

So decide what kind of talk will be allowed.



If you haven't done so in a long while,

It's time to put your thoughts on trial

And sentence the useless ones to exile.



When generosity is the way you have chosen,

Nothing - not even your time - can be stolen.

Your giving is the way to be afraid of no one.



You don't need to think ill of anyone,

Just let the course of their habits run

And weigh for yourself the outcome.



Letting others decide your time's terms

Is letting your field be farmed by worms:

You be the one who rejects or confirms.



Even though troubles might be unavoidable,

Become so giving that you're unexploitable

And your work will forever feel enjoyable.



When you do not need even one more thing,

That is when you can actually begin to bring

Gifts to all - whether they criticize or cling.



Without needing to be the judge or the jury,

Without absorbing the passion, pain or fury,

Give everyone the right to their own story.



They expect you to help bear their burden,

And even though they may feel so certain,

You are here to be a light and free person.



You made the decision to shift.

You don't need to create a list.

You get to decide, then insist.



Help doesn't need to be your last resort.

This time, it'll be wisest to stop short.

Stay here and wait for a bit of support.



In order to set the best possible tone,

Stay focused on what you actually own

And be willing and able to begin alone.



Whatever seems out of control and absurd,

Looks so whenever your vision is blurred.

Clarity appears as you choose your words.



Knowing where to draw your line

Is going to take a bit more time.

Exactly where, is for you to find.



Unless it includes generosity,

It's not wealth (it's poverty):

Mindset is your top priority.



Is any of it moving backwards?

Are there far too many factors?

What one thing truly matters?



Don't think of everyone - focus on a few.

And of them, only the small fraction who

You can directly talk and deeply listen to.



When they say things that are spurious,

Allow yourself to become a bit furious.

But of the deeper reason, be so curious.



Yes indeed - they gave you an ultimatum.

Know it's nothing more than a statement

Reminding you it's time to stop waiting.



Whenever you start to feel angry,

Something is telling you frankly

You need to revisit it blankly.



Incompetence can show up anywhere.

And taunt you? It will certainly dare.

Trap it in your most all-seeing stare.



Showing your temper may have one benefit:

It will shift the tone from falsely delicate

And force the focus onto what is relevant.



It doesn't always look happy - it won't.

But radiate, even when feeling provoked.

This will end up being what you hoped.



Bow to the fact that you have triggers,

That you have feelings so much bigger

Than resistance, and so much quicker.



With or without any given title,

You are the center of this cycle.

Your heartbeat's rhythm is vital.



Holding space means getting tired

Unless you get everything rewired

To only act when you're inspired.



Rather than sitting around maybe waiting

For those prone to resisting and debating,

You can be locking the door and creating.



Check in with your heart either way.

It is the only thing on any given day

With advice on all you think or say.



Keep changing approaches if you want to,

But keep the lesson each one teaches you

To grow your treasure of personal truth.



Consider this a dare to be a beginner again,

To forget all about how, or what, or when,

And just experiment, mess up, play, pretend!



When people do things that are just mean,

You're just the lucky one caught in between

Where you're going and where they've been.



Walk all around what you have for a home -

The inner place you live when you're alone,

Where your mind rents and your heart owns.



Hummingbirds fly fast, trees sway slow -

Most things in nature have a preset flow,

But you can change your pace as you go.



So long as you have nothing to prove,

And know exactly what you are up to,

You can put everything to good use.



It will be wisest to wait the news out

With your heart's hand over your mouth

Until you feel what this is all about.



It is alright to change your mind.

Decisive people do it all the time

Based on the new things they find.



The way through this, or any struggle

Is to deeply know all of your numbers

So nothing is left to doubt or wonder.



Who cares if you haven't gotten it yet?

You can go without and still be content:

Live like your needs have all been met.



It is fine for them to ask it of you.

It is fine for you to do all of it too.

It is also fine for you to just refuse.



It was generous of you to go over there -

But of overextending yourself, do beware:

You are long overdue for extensive self-care.



Look around and feel if you belong here,

Or if you're just settling for what's near:

Is the benefit of what's around you clear?



Too many things happened all at once,

But instead of reacting quite so much,

You need to let your presence show up.



Sometimes it's too late to hope for a fix

Once it all gets this thoroughly-mixed -

You need to be deliberate but not quick.



Move one step ahead - two if you can.

Get far in front by making your plan,

And then make it the law of your land.



You didn't wish to be where you are now,

But what you've created deserves a bow -

Because you fell in but flew yourself out.



You have woken up inside this circumstance

That looks like anything but another chance,

But your abilities are about to be enhanced.



Of course you're not always right,

But you've got incredible insight

To move from darkness into light.



Sleep on it - let one good night of rest help

Your whole decision-making process go well

By bringing you back to your original self.



Forget about proving it -

But be all about doing it

By just truly choosing it.



Turn away from reactive mode, 

Away from feeling you are owed;

Turn toward where you can grow.



Whether or not you see them as signs,

They're appearing to you all the time,

Not so much to teach - but to remind.



It's hard to dream once you're awake.

So clean it out, not for its own sake -

But for what doing it later will take.



If it's about tasks, you'll never be done.

If it's about levels, they'll never be won.

If it's about you, it will be forever fun.



You don't have to like what they bring.

Nor act as if you consider it interesting.

Get better at enjoying your own thing.



Check the way you're talking to yourself:

Better words raise your lifetime's wealth.

Better tones raise your heartbeat's health.



It's going to be a mistake if you do assume

Things will all work themselves out soon:

Consciously create your breathing room.



Decide what you'd do despite the pain.

Decide what you'd let remain the same.

Decide what you're here now to change.



To understand what makes you so strong,

Let go of belongings as you move along:

What's left is what's never been wrong.



It's alright to find yourself in a mess.

It's alright to walk in a fog of stress.

It's alright to not return here again.



You're going to end up feeling stress.

But the point is what you'll feel next:

Pain or purpose when you do it again.



Your body knows what you should now do

And will explain using subtle inner clues.

This is the only thing that counts as true.



In no time, all of this will be behind you.

And then do you know what you will do?

Feel into that right now rather than soon.



Does this feel a little bit past your limits?

Continue. You're built from these little bits.

Trust that everything you do somehow fits.



Adding one more thing takes something away

From letting things be what they are today -

Filling up emptiness leads your focus astray.



Congratulations! Welcome to the unknown -

To this place that may make you feel alone,

But that opens you to possibilities untold.



Whatever you can get this excited about

Is what your focus should center around

So you become one harmonious sound.



No one can tell you the road ahead for you

Because it gets remade based on all you do;

So take advice as inspiration, not as truth.



Words become walls that block life's wind.

Beware the ones you choose to live within.

Use ones that serve you well - lose or win.



You have not had even one enemy,

Just people who showed painfully

All that you needed to see: So see.



You will learn after going too far

Where you most undeniably are,

And find yourself a guiding star.



Do thoughts about other possible roads

Put upon you heavier or lighter loads?

That may tell you which to leave alone.



To get to the heart of this matter,

Listen to some of the daily chatter

And filter out the nonsense faster.



It's not a sign of greed, but of wealth,

An abundance of both love and health

To take ever better care of yourself.



No matter which of them are demanders,

You are the one who has to set standards,

And then the results will be even grander.



You need to create an actual schedule -

To turn it from just something mental

Into transportation to your next level.



First you got to enjoy feeling inspired,

After that, your presence was required.

Now, you need genuine rest when tired.



If you expect the passing of time

To almost magically make you wise,

You need to reconsider your why.



When did you last refuse the traditional?

So go do something wholly unpredictable:

For your heart, it will be truly medicinal.



Learn most from whoever complains

About how their life has remained,

And see what you two do the same.



Without any plans, it's a messy assortment.

Until you schedule, potential lies dormant.

Once you start, you learn what's important.



If that leads somewhere you dread,

Why not do what you feel instead?

Trust your heart over your head.



Here is one you simply must try:

Just journey without asking why

And where the road ends - fly.



Whatever you want, match in attitude

And it will come to you rather soon.

You have already lived your proof.



No need to fully enjoy where you are, 

But doing so will take you quite far:

Enough twinkles add up to a star.



Where in your character does that fit?

Might it help or hurt the rest of this?

Can you create a life lived without it?



For decisions like this, talk to someone

Who had to get something like this done.

Minds can work better as two than as one.



Sometimes we can use the past as an excuse.

Other times it can be put to very good use.

Those who rewrite yours count as fools.



Say what you enjoy. Tell yourself every day.

For finding your path, this is the best way.

What better road than the one your joy paves!



You need to get so specific and clear

About what you want to be right here,

Because momentum draws everything near.



That may be exactly the way not to go -

The one where the riverbanks overflow;

Turn before your steps reach tomorrow.



No one else has to agree. 

No one even needs to see.

Everyone must let you be.



As for what you'll leave behind,

Cast that idea out of your mind.

Be inwardly, then outwardly kind.



Do you think of your schedule like a contract?

You could also treat it something like a map.

Let there be consequences for going off track.



Once in a while, anger will be a useful tool.

Usually, it makes you appear to play the fool.

Either way, own the whole of it, as a rule.



Think of every space you step into as special.

If you enter one in some hurry, stop - settle.

That you bring peace into a room is essential.



You can't reverse anyone's misperception,

Or undo doubt with any excuse you mention:

All you can do is live your own intention.



Yes, no matter which direction you choose,

Change is coming, no matter what you do.

So no matter what, figure out what is true.



Sometimes it's not right to compromise.

Some sounds are too loud to harmonize.

This gets easier and easier to recognize.



Exactly why would you think such a thought?

It's like some gift you never would've bought.

It's contagious, so heal from what you caught.



Come to ignore whoever this truth annoys:

You've done the work to make the choice

To have full ownership of your own voice.



Truly, and first of all, love what you do.

But right behind that, own all of it, too.

This is how to design a life built for you.



How will it go, if you start and then stop?

What's the point if you catch and then drop?

You need to tend to this as a lifelong crop.



That was a convenient substitute for action,

But you're in this for more than satisfaction

So operate closest to your oldest passions.



It is time for a change in your conversation -

To listen longer, make fewer declarations

And speak of insights, not frustrations.



Once you are standing up in this fully,

Details will no longer be able to bully

(Everything makes way for certainty).



If it is a choice that cannot be undone,

Think of other ways to change the outcome.

This is a skill that will keep you young.



You don't need to finish - simply start.

Love is in love with your lovely heart.

Connecting is the most important part.



Though you may be told this is impractical,

Imagine how you'd handle the unimaginable.

This will show you everything is manageable.



You don't get to perfect everything at once,

Nor can an animal pick several things to hunt

If it wants to catch what it leaps to confront.



It's fitting that you don't get to see the rest,

Because that would make this like some test;

This goes beyond every good, better and best.



Set times you don't wish to be disturbed.

If interrupted, repeat until you're heard,

"Be disappointed. I will not be stirred."



You need to be working on your craft,

Because all you have already amassed

Points to the future - but is the past.



Time will change you - body, mind and soul.

But what keeps you from growing wearily old

Is your ability to remain flexible and bold.



You're looking back if you're outrunning.

Better to look up ahead toward something:

You live your best when you're becoming.



You are not here to undertake projects -

You are here because you mirror reflect

All that there is - you're already perfect.



This something you're yearning to do -

Don't finish it as something to prove -

Let it be something that enjoys You too.



Let how you feel be your truest guide,

Work less on What than on your Why

And when mistaken, change your mind.



Inviting so much noise into your core

Is not what the act of inviting is for -

Add a step between meeting and more.



If you only do what comes naturally,

You'll only live within probability:

Free yourself to move unpredictably.



Ask yourself, before you say yes -

Not whether one decision is best -

But how it will benefit the next.



What helps you handle each change?

What in you has remained the same?

What you've found is where to stay.



You can work at something for so long

That it can cease to make you strong.

There is somewhere else you belong.



Building up from the ground is unwise.

Up from foundations do buildings rise,

So location is as important as supplies.



Sometimes in order to avoid feeling shame,

The mind looks anywhere else to find blame

Rather than at the very one who complains.



Rather than getting yourself uptight,

Know you're not here to get it right:

You are here to sharpen your insight.



The only proof of harmony is in the song.

Find your right by recognizing the wrong.

What should you truly not be working on?



Self-sabotage is stealthy and merciless.

So as each new thing invites your best,

Keep a loving eye on what you do next.



The part of you that wants to contribute

Keeps arguing against thoughts in you

That prefer to question anything new.



Security will take a different form -

One that cannot be lived in or worn

Yet can keep you every bit as warm.



Be a keeper of the space. Take your role.

This is about responsibility, not control.

Treat tasks as an expression of your soul.



As keeper of this space, it is your role

To maintain a voice that is your own

And over key details, practice control.



Sometimes you must cut a cord to survive,

Or find yourself living, but not fully alive:

Do so, and reach somewhere deeper inside.



You need new rituals that support this,

Or you'll toss, turn and even throw fits

As you grow into what your new life is.



You are surrounded on all sides by sages.

They will all reveal themselves in stages.

Be the pupil in each of today's exchanges.



There's no one to punish: be understanding.

You shrink your power by being demanding.

Helping with the solution means expanding.



Expectation ruins things' natural appeal

By framing each as a give-and-take deal:

Life's as wonderful as you're able to feel.



Moods run in cycles, but something remains

In you always unmoved - forever unchanged.

Hearing its voice makes the moods run away.



You need to keep things fresh and uncertain.

Every day, pull back some unfamiliar curtain.

It's not about the finding - it's the searching.



Do what energizes, not what drains.

No matter what, this advice remains.

What you enjoy is where you'll gain.



Your thinking is becoming too intricate.

Numbers aren't what make it legitimate.

Next time, it needs to be small, intimate.



Rather than constantly feeling surprised,

What would it be like to feel energized?

Could this question become your guide?



Invite your newest friendships gradually.

Take time, to perceive things accurately

So when you know, you know actually.



Carefully, carefully mind your loops -

Those thought patterns you slip into.

And once one starts, regroup, regroup.



In case you forget, you are here to love,

Not to collect issues to then rise above.

Kindness is the hand, you are the glove.



Who knows how this ends up turning out?

Whoever claims to has less mind than mouth.

What always works is to water what sprouts.



The only way to figure out what's missing

Is to stop waiting to talk - wait to listen.

Then you'll be equipped for this mission.



For all this to work, you'll need to declare

The boundaries within which you'll share

And around which ill-will needs to beware.



Giving it your voice is a very serious step:

You own the essence of what you say next,

So let your words be fruitful yet content.



Even if it should last until you grow old,

This is nothing more than a temporary role

And is but the tiniest sliver of your soul.



How you talk about that places you in it,

Either as proud owner or griping tenant,

So speak from the role you expect to fit. 



This is not going to last forever -

Just until more pieces fit together

Or you start using your time better.



Share who you are with everyone next.

Even if it feels like it's making a mess.

You're giving a gift, not taking a test.



Wrap your mind around this entire space.

Let no chance to learn more go to waste,

And share each as you put things in place.



This is no longer that distant frontier.

You need to do more than dwell here,

So start focusing on the atmosphere.



This is not a time to be the diplomat:

Speak up and tell them not to do that.

Be protective of your heart's habitat.



Every time you speak, there's an energy

That reaches out far more than just mentally

And abides in the hearer's heart's memory.



It's nothing but a word - a made-up name.

Without it, would you be acting the same?

With it, are you able to make some gain?



If there are two roles that need filling, 

Take the one that makes you more willing,

Not the one that others say is thrilling.



Don't go back there. The reason is this:

What binds them together was never a fit

For the energy you've been working with.



Go ahead - you'll grow your curiosity.

Go find who today wants you to meet.

Go discover, or await, this next treat.



Be reminded by talking with someone older

Of when your own winters were much colder.

Let memory serve to make you even bolder.



Is that input helping make things steady?

Words have to match for when you're ready,

Or else they're just theories - just heady.



There is a difference between the two -

Not in the talents you need to use, but

In the energy you need to redistribute.



It's just as pointless to chase the dark

As it is to linger in the fully-lit part:

You should be navigating via your heart.



You never know who knows who,

So be mindful what you're up to.

Only share what you know is true.



If the best of it fills you with pleasure,

And the worst of it you rarely measure,

Then it is one of your life's treasures.



If some result is in the back of your mind,

Your motivation will eventually unwind;

Loving your process should be your why.



Wanting to have that is a level of interest

That's good, but not better, and not best:

Wanting to give this outranks all the rest.



You need certainty, now more than ever.

Because certainty makes its own weather

And will keep all your energies together.



Move it into the center of your efforts,

Not because it needs to be there forever,

But because you need it more than ever.



It's time to measure what you've done -

It's not the same as measuring outcome:

Measure out what you've actually begun.



Study as many mistakes as you can gather,

Or live them firsthand if you would rather;

Each one adds a rung to your life's ladder.



Keep them at a distance if they delay.

Keep them farther if their efforts sway.

Keep them close if they are underway.



Right now, focus on the necessary tasks -

The ones you need to do for when they ask

Whether you possess all you need to have.



Is this what you actually believe?

Have you lived it or merely seen?

What within you does this please?



Stretch this past the comfortable limit.

If there's anything more to give, give it.

What you are now tapping into is spirit.



Filling up on stories may feel enough -

But what's actually filling you is a love

That words are just traveling on top of.



You need to know just enough to begin,

But not so much you won't head on in:

You'll learn to sail once there is wind.



One question keeps your daily focus solid:

Are you solving your own actual problems?

This is how you earn priceless knowledge.



That story has its own length and limits.

You don't, even if you put yourself in it.

Energy overflows whatever it tries to fit.



You didn't come here to tell that one story.

Put it in the back of your mind's inventory,

And offer someone else the praise and glory.



If it can be bought, you won't need it.

If it can be forgotten, let them keep it.

If it quiets you, take a moment to be it.



If you do it that way, it won't be natural.

It's one thing to try and become masterful,

But more wondrous a journey to be gradual.



Put everything out there - up on the wall -

Hold nothing back, let everyone see it all;

Whatever held you back is now very small.



Acknowledge that it's time to redirect

Your energy so it can finally reconnect

Your efforts with your original intent.



If you agree that things have changed,

Can you also point them out by name?

Have you noticed what's still the same?



You're a way of being, you are not a name,

And that way of being, you can also change

In any way at all. Forget yesterday's range. 



Stress is your greatest mentor and friend.

Without it, you would always overextend.

It teaches you, before you break, to bend.



Sometimes those feelings can overwhelm,

But keep heading to the center of yourself:

And you will soon be back in your realm.



The trivialities you put in your own way

Are enough to lead your attention astray,

But not for long - so end this interplay.



Even after it has all been delivered,

You will still need to have considered

What your heart has already whispered.



Achieve the things to know how that feels,

Then pause to reflect on what you have seen

And you will understand what it all means.



Stop yourself from cleaning their floors.

Stop taking on their overlooked chores -

Their inner dwelling simply isn't yours.



Decide to get from it just what you need

And the time will pass more easily indeed;

Perspective is the voice you should heed.



Why do this any way but the natural one?

How do you know new ideas hold wisdom?

Answer these, even if you've already begun.



Lean times before and after abundant ones

Follow a night-day cycle like stars and sun:

Do you know which light's time has come?



Half of the journey is realizing you're there,

Deep in the place you'd been told to beware.

The rest is navigating your route elsewhere.



The same lesson is going to keep coming

Until you prove you're actually above it;

Learning to say no will be just as loving.



You feel you were clear, yet still ignored -

And of this cycle you've grown truly bored:

Your levels of directness are what to explore.



Interruptions - they tell you a lot

About what you didn't wish to stop

And what you instinctively dropped.



And how could it have seemed like such fun?

Well-wrapped won't always mean well-done.

Look at all sides - not just the shiniest one.



Whether you get help or do it all alone,

Put in the work to make this your home.

As much as you choose will be your own.



Don't theorize - try out each one fully.

Don't let either of them become a bully.

Above all, do not commit prematurely.



Setting aside time to care for yourself last

Should become an ugly habit of your past.

Self-care can be a way of living, not a task.



And if you're only doing enough to deliver,

You're becoming a most careless caregiver:

Your energy is like water - care is the river.



Listen to yourself, but not too terribly much.

Sometimes with thinking, enough is enough.

Consciously wait to meet what else comes up.



Then you will be done, just like that.

You will have the wind at your back,

And you will make a natural impact.



There are so many ways to interpret all this.

There are so many ways to make yourself fit.

There is only one way to authentically live.



Before you choose quickly, check once again.

Get someone else's experienced perspective:

Decisions work best when they're well-fed.



You make it harder to know what's coming

By thinking you need a little more cunning.

The way to find out is to be forthcoming.



A certain closeness is going to be required

To reach them in the way you have desired:

Do so through presence, not through wires.



Long-lasting is fine, but to what end?

What good is it to last but never bend?

Love stays vulnerable enough to mend.



It's as easy to slip into another realm

As it is to dive into what you've felt:

You'll go farther than words can tell.



You can think you know what's going on,

But you're better off assuming you're wrong;

What you need to do is just continue along.



Some naturally test your generosity's limits,

Reaching for more than you've already given.

But your sense of enough has already arisen.



What are all your assumptions based on?

Before you rush to fix, let it go "wrong."

You can learn a lot by just going along.



Whatever you're working so hard to solve

May not even need for you to be involved.

The next question: where do you belong?



Have you noticed yet - that there is no end

To setting goals that you then have to tend?

Always let your why overshadow the when.



You have the sharp senses of a sleuth.

What you perceived was accurate truth.

But it wasn't for them - it is for you.



Things are never as they initially seem;

Your worst day is someone else's dream.

(May your gratitude flow like a stream.)




If you think of your schedule as a parasite,

What cures it now or the rest of your life?

Moving around, resting well, eating right.



If you should live hundreds of years more,

Life will still have new adventures galore

When you are willing to open new doors.



Sometimes you learn more when you leave.

If you go see what others work to achieve,

You'll return to yourself no longer naive.



It is useful to feel into what feels right,

Sense into whatever makes you uptight,

And to see either one as a guiding light.



If the keys are here and you don't use them,

It's probably not a simple question of when:

You probably need to find your reasons again.



It's not that that goal wasn't big enough -

It's that you can keep continuing to go up;

It's that you can find higher levels of fun.



The hero, the victim, the villain - who else?

What other masks have you tried on yourself?

Live by your heart, where every mask melts.



Start speaking in a language of possibilities,

A new way that treats words as opportunities

And expands the range of what's here to see.



Yes, you can feel twice this expansive,

Your voice spreading its loving branches

Around your heart as it quietly dances.



If on the surface, it looks like a mess,

Would what's inside show anything less?

Tidy up - that invites everyone's best.



You begin asking for what you hope to hear,

And then truth comes that had not been clear:

This is your invitation to ride, but not steer.



When you resist the call to become clannish,

Some allies somehow, suddenly, just vanish;

They have done you a true favor, not damage.



The openness of the questions you ask

Will help you figure out the one task

That can get everything else on track.



The gift that ends up costing you is a joke -

Life presenting you a perfectly playful poke

About the difference between fire and smoke.



The quality of each relationship you grow

Is like the heartiness of the seeds you sow:

It's not just who (it's how well) you know.



What gives you strength, and what takes?

Yes - a few of your are answers are fakes -

Happiness doesn't lean on what it makes.



Now, rather than being on display,

Be who you were going to be anyway

By letting one less "necessity" stay.



Don't do it - it's not worth the trouble

If it only makes your workload double.

The wisest improvements are all subtle.



Coincidences help you as they always have,

Dropping unexpected situations into your lap

When you're not too attached to one set path.



Some of your interests only last for so long,

Because they need a group to matter at all.

Some interests are for life - that was seasonal.



What you give away gives you back a feeling,

Whether it's obligation, enjoyment or healing.

Which of the reasons lifts your inner ceiling?



Focus on relationships, not on transactions.

One creates beauty, the other is a reaction.

Patience, sow seeds of lifelong satisfaction.



You can get so energized by your problems

That you become determined to solve them,

So let your growing frustration broaden.



Though things may seem so sorted and neat,

It may mean that their pile-up is complete -

There are so many things that you can delete.



And when you find yourself on the other side

Of an argument you thought was so bona fide,

You'll find a love that opens your heart wide.



That part of your life that feels like a mess

Doesn't mean you're not doing your best -

It means you'll enjoy more by doing less.



What you will gain by giving it as a gift

Is far more than a brief emotional lift -

You will feel all your expectations shift.



What you are forming is a tangible tribe,

People who will surround you on all sides

As you all grow healthy, wealthy and wise.



There is no complication or condition

That can change your true disposition:

You are the magic - not the magician.



Once you remember there is nothing to do,

You wake yourself from other dreams too -

Like that one that lives comfortable truths.



Trying to give a warning everyone will heed

Is something at which you will not succeed

Because everyone fails exactly as they need.



Forget about ever being finished or done.

Free yourself from every desired outcome.

Focus on all you can feel from sun to sun.



You're going to get angry, and rightly so.

You never even had the chance to say no.

But now get carried right back into flow.



Is there something you think you can do

To shortcut your journey to your truth?

(The long way is the only way through.)



Forget about your own expertise or appeal.

It only matters to share from how you feel.

This is what's valuable and timelessly real.



You already know without being informed:

You find the patterns and then grow bored.

So choose the way with no obvious reward.



When even changes become predictable,

Your mindset's at a point that's pivotal,

So keep all outside influences minimal.



The parts you love are easy to keep doing.

The parts you don't, keep doubt brewing.

Keep on refining and keep on reviewing.



From the criticism to the compliments,

All you get to keep is your experience.

All you can do is be extremely present.



The differences start to become so subtle

That things can end up in a real muddle.

Practice patience and solve your puzzle.



As soon as you let the physical form of it go

You'll understand more than you now know.

Once you understand, all at once, you grow.



Cluelessness is one thing - denial is another.

Seek to lovingly heal, not to quietly smother.

Live in the open, leaving nothing undercover.



Your stories will not suddenly let you go.

That task falls to you, to your will alone.

So limit how many stories you condone.



They are not intending to take advantage,

They are in the habit of leaving baggage.

Remember what you are here to manage.



Not far beneath, scavengers still squirm,

Trying to undermine some of your terms.

Be loving, and at the same time, be firm.



It is not your job, nor your place to fix.

Anyone who says so is up to clever tricks.

It is your duty to invite courage to stick.



Your stories speak, but can they also hear?

Each has its own voice - do any have ears?

Which one actually makes your way clear?



You don't need to have total control.

You don't need to get any ideas sold.

You need to open up as life unfolds.



Perfectionism is usually unwise.

Conscious work is good exercise.

Leave room to love life's surprise.



Not every day is incredibly amazing. 

Not every path finds you trailblazing.

But is this moment not breathtaking?



Considering where all of your time went,

Being protective does make a lot of sense.

Once you've recovered, carefully reorient.



Do not be moved - you are not time's servant.

You are not here to grow forevermore fervent,

But if anything, to be forevermore observant.



What you know is not required.

Expertise makes listeners tired.

How you are is what inspires.



Pain can be a very useful sensation to feel

To find out what's both broken and real.

So use it to figure out just what to heal.



There's only so much you can tell a story.

After awhile even the best becomes boring.

Just as much silence is far more restoring. 



When sitting still, everyone seems true.

But you discover who's in support of you

Once you set out toward something new.



You can only give from what overflows,

Or else you stunt your very own growth.

So fill yourself full long before you go.



Stop. Those questions are too big.

They ask you to tunnel - just dig.

You need to rethink, not renege.



When you end up doing "more than you can,"

You learn how much more you can withstand,

Because the heart is wealthier than the hand.



This is not the place for absolutes -

This is the space for today's truths.

So just what is it that you're up to?



If no one had gotten in your way,

You wouldn't be all you are today:

Discovery's viewfinder is dismay.



You don't need an exact plan,

But knowing where you stand

Is good both for feet and hands.



If you feel yourself coming unhinged,

Or as if your peace is being infringed,

To what is your sense of self pinned?



You need this pain - in order to work.

Focus tends to focus on whatever hurts.

It finds, fixes or flushes whatever lurks.



If just for today, maybe even a bit beyond,

You choose not to put that thought coat on,

You will become your own source of dawn.



Giving them space to hear themselves speak

Makes them feel more than safely unique -

It frees them all from judgment's critique.



To whomever you give the power of voice,

You also grant them the power of choice

And tools to dismantle whatever exploits. 



Pushing will eventually be pushed back.

Be mindful if you're ever on the attack,

What you put out, you will also attract.



What you need to know is already here.

Whenever needed, experts always appear.

Ask someone or simply sit and overhear.



As long as there is always some "next,"

You can keep adding unnecessary steps.

The best gift is to unwrap your present.



Because your mind did not get you here,

It is not the passenger to invite to steer:

Your heart is what decides what is clear.



Provide yourself the chance to sit still,

To rest your mind and retire your will,

And you have your most valuable skill.



You need a space where you can reset

From the constant give, give and get.

Do you know if you've created it yet?



Frustration will find you, but don't flee

(Breakthroughs are fueled by difficulty).

Face what you'd rather not, and willingly.



It's fine if you want to talk a lot.

It's fine if you would rather not.

Let your needs be aforethought.



At this point, be mindful who

You share or give your work to.

For now, keep the number few.



If one thing complicates something else,

It is wise to check back in with yourself:

Complexity complicates a mind's health.



Waking up without so many concerns

Lets you take on so much more work.

So start going to sleep this way first.



You treat it as if it needs no mention, but

What you're doing you must also question.

You must seek and set your own intention.



Memories may shine light or cast shadows.

Making new ones is all you need to handle.

Keep your focus from getting too narrow.



Nothing's as simple as what you'd thought.

Nothing you know's all right or all wrong.

Nothing that blocks you will be here long.



Get your mind to align with this reality:

On the other side of drama and hyperbole

Results come based on what you believe.



Though you may prefer this weather,

You don't get to linger here forever.

Become oblivious to worse and better.



When all you want to happen doesn't occur,

What within you does that realization stir?

Stay for all that these feelings will confer.



Even where balance seems to slant,

There's a joy stillness always grants.

Notice where its silent leaves land.



Yes, you had to do it that way once.

No, there wasn't time left to discuss.

Maybe now you know who to confront.



You have so many moods - so many facets.

In the wrong situation, one is a bad habit.

In the right situation, each can be an asset.



For as long as you need to feel safe,

You will feel the need to seek escape;

Intensify your need to feel engaged.



Friends who only give complaints,

Are enemies of your peaceful state

Who serve you best when far away.



You may feel you've been totally upfront.

You may think you've said quite enough.

You're not getting through. So, be blunt.



Quietly come back to the same situation,

Where you told yourself about irritation.

This time, silence the inner conversation.



It's different than how your mind sees it,

Because your mind cannot see your spirit.

Your quietest mind is your most coherent.



If ever you feel yourself suffering,

Do the work of mental decluttering

And you'll feel yourself recovering.



When you are listening genuinely,

Without trying to correct or agree,

You can heal hurt with an apology.



They will expect certain things of you,

When they hold you to their own truth.

There is nothing you need to do/prove.



For as long as there's some set amount

To measure if your work worked out,

You overlook what you can't count. 



Things get rough, then you get loud -

Makes sense when reaction is allowed.

What if you just yielded and bowed?



Does that get under your skin?

You'll learn more by giving in

Than you will taking the win.



The best way to enrich your own life

Is to give others their wings to fly,

Which happens every time you try.



Where exactly are those questions headed?

Where someone else is given all the credit?

Or where you give your part proper merit?



The memories you treasure most dearly,

You treasure for how you felt, sincerely.

Why not relive that feeling now clearly?



This is a good time to create and not travel -

A time to return home and build your castle,

A time to prepare yourself for a brief battle.



Don't just agree to what's being offered -

Feel into the part of it that feels awkward

And decide what you need to have altered.



Don't worry about breathing each breath.

Let your instinct take care of that instead;

Turn all of your attention toward silence.



First it feels like you've reached a limit,

Then you realize, it's just time to pivot.

Choose your approach and now, live it.



You don't get the option to turn your back,

Because that's when detractors will attack:

You must stay, deliver, engage and interact.



There is no point to more information

Until you take time for contemplation,

The kind without heady conversation.



All those trends deserve your distrust.

Getting yourself to feel sincere disgust

Is how you turn your should to a must.



While it serves you, feel free to measure.

But you'll have arrived once you treasure

The way your parts work so well together.



Understand all they can ever be are tools.

It is up to you to put them to proper use.

They are here to serve your chosen rules.



When something is treated in a certain way,

It can become difficult for you to innovate.

So that may not be the path you should take.



Unless/until your heart tells you to quit,

Grow more than a feeling of ownership:

Grow your own real inner peace with it.



Though delivered with a degree of certainty,

Certain can also be wrong, even mistakenly.

Do your own research, and do it thoroughly.



A quiet moment to yourself is all you need.

And if you take another each day, eventually

You will have grown a forest from one seed.



Adding too many things subtracts from each.

Tend only and exactly to what you can reach,

And be quick to study, but so slow to teach.



Should you think about it by speaking aloud?

Will you believe thoughts that draw a crowd?

Or are these something you should shroud?



You start by silencing all the outside voices

So you can once again make actual choices

That once again let all of this feel joyous.



It has been so long - start even farther back

(injury can put you even farther off track) -

The mindset of an approach versus an attack.



Though you are given opportunities galore,

Work on what you're working on - not more.

Until it's time to come out, close your door.



When you began, you needed to be so blunt.

You were heading from the back to the front.

Now, you must be subtle in what you adjust.



For evidence, you will not need to look far:

Days change the small, you change the large.

Of how you feel about it, you are in charge.



As soon as the flow of listening feels broken,

Put an end to your momentum - take notice:

You are not here to convince - but to be open.



As soon as possible, simplify the given steps,

Removing as many as it takes in order to get

To the end goal, rather than just to each next.



It may not be at all about the chase.

Check inside to see if that is the case:

What you love most may be this space.



Offers are coming in from every side.

Most offer yet another place to hide -

One points directly to your own light.



Surrender if you're battling problems.

Fighting them never truly solves them.

Lasting solutions come once you soften.



This process will end in a breakthrough.

Identifying circular patterns is step two:

First, realize you can do something new.



Today's journey is about managing state -

Not about being in the exact same place -

But about conscious, courageous change.



Not yet, keep thinking about it some more.

If you think of where you're at as the floor,

How high a ceiling might there be in store?



An experience that feels truly negative,

Is actually the one that is ready to give

You secrets about your new way to live.



Imagine that you're not the only one here -

Going through things this difficult yet dear:

Help them by making your own way clear.



You've actually solved a bigger problem here:

You've actually taught yourself how to steer

When others actually make the way unclear.



Figure out how this opportunity fits in -

Where you're going, where you've been,

Or where you can be here now and win.



Realize there is a purpose to it all.

You must see it, despite how small.

One action by itself can stand tall.



You have skills - they're not your purpose.

Don't be an expert - be your whole person.

Put yourself where you feel most earnest.



Although it's easy, doesn't mean you should.

You no longer stand where you once stood.

Point yourself toward your highest good.



Better still. Yes, you can do much better.

Must that rule be followed to the letter?

There's history tied to it? Cut the tether.



Though you want tomorrow to come sooner,

The greatest gift of not knowing the future

Is that it forces you to do today smoother.



The past is worthwhile for what you can use.

But if you linger, there's much you can lose.

Move on. Bring along only its very best tools.



You can journey straight or you can wander -

Needing applause may make it all take longer.

Working in silence will make you stronger.



Even if it's more fitting to complain,

Shift it all into the best-fitting frame

And problems will never be the same.



Though at the moment you may be hurting,

What you've been given is far from a burden:

It's an invitation to a more-specific certain.



The lessons you're looking for are all around.

Are you looking for one that feels profound?

Choose one that's useful here on the ground.



Look around: this moment is truly beautiful.

The parts you love aren't even the best of all;

The parts you don't, contain what's magical.



Winning feeds some people's souls,

For others, it's now how they grow.

Let both teach you what they know.



While your plan should be a flexible line,

It doesn't mean they can waste your time:

How you treat them is how you remind.



Beware of getting fixated on tomorrow,

Giving it today's time that you borrow.

Can you leave the rest of today hollow?



All you need to do is quietly listen

For the themes of drama and friction

Then quietly return to your mission.



What's the difference between this and that?

Do you even realize what you're looking at?

What if you turned away from both and sat?



The ingredients can only come together here,

And especially when you're certain and clear

About which go in when and which interfere.



Not everything belongs in your space.

Some items are just too commonplace.

Which ones put a smile on your face?



Analysis is like blood without a pulse:

Without action, words won't be enough.

Are you mastering analysis or results?



Why did you do it that specific way?

Stubbornness, desire, a sense of play?

Don't answer - be yourself all day.



Do you need to look into the future,

Or could the present be your tutor?

The great teachings hide in humor.



You're an artist. Today is your latest

Work along the way toward your greatest.

You're making this masterpiece in stages.



To the normal approach, be resistant.

No, it is not your job to be consistent:

Your job for now is self-commitment.



Whether you feel this is fast or slow,

You still have a very long way to go.

All you can do is focus on your flow.



What you once feared, can no longer happen

Because you have learned and now mastered

How to use today to magnify what matters.



Finding yourself along a preexisting track,

Your best way forward is all the way back

To avoid whatever else that road attracts.



Are you in this with something to sell?

Are you doing this for the story to tell?

Do you want to look good - or be well?



And if the thing you do is always the same,

You'll be doing a disservice to your brain:

What creativity doesn't need to be is trained.



Your relationships are more than a reflection -

They do more than provide social protection:

They help decide the whole world's direction.



Don't choose the wrong side of this debate:

You are allowed, even designed, to change.

Either against or along time, you can play.



How many more things do you have to say?

If you forgot one, would the rest go astray?

If you said none, would you be you anyway?



Watching others fade into their rituals,

Can create difficult-to-witness visuals.

Make this conscious observing habitual.



If you have only so much time, what to do!

Yet one moment can feel like forever, too.

Perspective breaks down or breaks through.



This always serves as a useful tool:

For a moment, play the role of fool,

Asking things no one else thinks to.



You are hearing the movement of a mouth

That may not know what it's talking about.

You're the one who has to work things out.



The answers don't come by waiting here.

No amount more study will make it clear.

Clarity comes from what you let disappear.



You're asking the right questions, yes.

But it's the answers that fail truth's test.

What other ways lead from better to best?



If you can see this as a complete spectrum,

It won't matter if they're being ambiguous:

There are no absolutes - just a continuum.



You love to laugh - so are you laughing?

The kind that has you joyously gasping?

Just how might you make this happen?



Ask a few more specific questions -

Ones deeper than already mentioned.

Does this raise or ease the tension?



Once you stop basing today on the past,

And forget about how long you can last,

You will wonder how you did it so fast.



Your feelings on it run the whole spectrum.

So if there is within each one a little lesson,

It is that you are a fluid and flowing essence.



No, it is not that you need to hurry up.

It's that you need to reach your Enough

So you can be sharing it with everyone.



There are so many things left to do,

But they are not ones you're used to:

Today's tasks all need you to be new.



Are you supposed to have a fresh approach?

Or should you be finding yourself a coach?

Do first and last what energizes you most.



Literally or figuratively, this is wise:

Your best course will be to get outside

To let more emptiness into your mind.



You are not being broken apart -

Hurt is what widens your heart

And deepens the deepest part.



Trust that you are going to finish -

It's nothing that time can diminish.

You yourself are going to witness.



Though it's easier to continue staying here,

Where you're headed, all of this disappears

Because it's a totally different atmosphere.



Things that feel like they have come too early

Have arrived just in time to start a new story.

It's the expectations that landed prematurely.



For awhile, you compensate for an injury

By depending on other parts of your body

In a way that should only last temporarily.



Times will be lean. Times will be abundant.

Times will be, regardless of your judgment.

And over time, patience will be triumphant.



Do this over and over again as you wish.

But once it's something you can dismiss,

Let your farewell be unflinchingly quick.



This is one time when being sentimental

Will end up being somewhat detrimental.

Unflinching clear-headedness is essential.



You may not want to have interaction,

But this is not about your satisfaction.

This is about moving past distraction.



Once you let anything become a pattern,

You begin to expect a future to happen,

So intentionally change your reaction.



If you find yourself without true support,

Then you can treat this as a game or sport

In which opponents are very easy to sort.



If your motivation is to sincerely serve,

There'll always be a need for your work,

And you'll always know what to do first.



If you don't know what to do first,

Check the motivation for your work.

Do you do this to impress or serve?



You are still reorienting yourself -

How to balance work, life, health -

How to define your kind of wealth.



If you desperately need a long vacation

Just to recover from your occupation,

What you need is mindset relocation.



You can't always be what you once felt.

You are welcomed to redefine yourself.

In fact, it is very good for your health.



To share life's best outlook,

Forget who gave and who took.

Help people feel understood.



It is so important to call people by name

For its awakening effect inside the brain.

Practice this habit throughout every day.



This has nothing to do with being educated -

It can only consist of what you've dedicated.

What have your own actions demonstrated?



Be mindful on whom you depend.

And if you are let down yet again,

Answer, is this the act of a friend?



Even though you have no idea whether

Any of this is going to come together,

Preparation will keep making you better.



You're looking for some answer elsewhere

Because looking within gives you a scare;

The only truth-teller is how you prepare.



It comes down to your actual behaviors -

What in you steps up, what in you wavers.

When in need, ask for honesty, not favors.



Picture a future, far out as you can dream.

And as impossible as it may at first seem,

Your mind is already assembling a team.



No need to work on the past, it just fades.

Whatever you need of it is what remains.

Focus your energy on today, today, today.



If you partner yourself up with lack,

The focus shifts to defensive attacks:

It's not too late to disarm and detach.



Are you gracious when you win?

Or does a youthful pride kick in?

At any age, immaturity can begin.



Is everyone growing their skills?

If not, defeat most certainly will.

What talents failure can instill!



You are getting better - at what?

At saying "and" or saying "but"?

At knowing which doors to shut?



You won't find yourself "here" ever again.

And "now" is its own ever-changing when.

What you can "do" is be flexible and bend.



You have developed the perfect set of skills

To accomplish exactly what it is you will.

And you did it without some set "until."



You will be asked to make yourself clearer

By those who would rather not come nearer

(You're not necessarily everyone's mirror).



Notice areas you normally neglect,

Where expectations quietly collect.

Focus on being supportive yet direct.



What about times when you don't react?

Is there something you're holding back?

What is it that keeps your peace intact?



Are those really your primary concerns?

If so, then what have you really learned?

What is the issue that has to come first?



When the mood seems suddenly tense,

It's because of an unpleasant influence

That can be undone by making amends.



What triggers your loudest alarm?

What makes you immediately calm?

Knowing each is the key to charm.



Habits determine your overall health.

Master yourself by observing yourself.

Inward insight is the soul of wealth.



Remove all the layers and reach the source

Where you'll think to yourself, "Of course,

This is what I originally traveled here for!"



Once you're in the right environment,

It will feel like sheer enlightenment.

Showing up is the only requirement.



What exactly do you need to know

Before you can give your say-so?

Only one key detail is apropos.



Once you decide to uproot stress,

You'll have to examine each mess

And decide which part to address. 



If you're experiencing too much contrast,

Advice for precisely this has come at last,

These three words: Get unconfused fast.



Your words can convince everyone but you.

Your heart knows what you're truly up to.

Your promises must carry personal value.



Before you sell your ideas, know yourself

Or else it will be that much harder to tell

What to do when things start going well.



It's hard to hear, but you're in the way

Of your progress on this particular day:

Think about everything you tend to say.



Your own language constructs a blockade

Or breaks through one and paves straight:

How do you speak of it? What do you say?



The importance of what you steadily focus on

Is something you cannot afford to get wrong:

The subtle changes are what make you strong.



Changing the wrong doesn't guarantee right.

Battling the darkness doesn't ensure you light.

Focusing your good makes everything bright.



For as long as you consider that offensive,

You language is limited to being defensive:

You are ready to be vastly more inventive.



Do you once again find yourself The Helper?

Once again building someone else's shelter?

Imagine for yourself a different storyteller.



After listening to more than one excuse,

You need to put listening to better use -

Things such as how to actually produce.



Listen to those with actual experience,

To what's said, as well as what's meant,

To how they mastered heart and head.



Even if you wrestle a bit with doubt,

Continue to refine what you're about:

Thought and action in proper amount.



One sure way to limit your sum,

Is to desire a specific outcome.

Gifts are here - more than one.



Your idea of lasting security,

Does it involve a life of ease?

Does it include a community?



Step far enough away this time

So you can completely redesign

What you initially had in mind.



Just because they ask, you don't have to.

Feeling obligated leads to feeling used.

Always be aware of being free to choose.



Give out as much as you like, but be aware

Of what you need for your own self-care.

You must first have before you can share.



You don't need to know every single thing,

But give your bird's-eye view some wings

By learning about what's now occurring.



They can't meet you where you hope to be,

But only where you put yourself actually.

Dream, but wake up and work this reality.



You're going to have to cut some things back

To make space for what you intend to attract:

Opportunity prefers you ready - and relaxed.



Never consider your hardship a curse,

Since someone somewhere has it worse.

You can be glum, but be grateful first.



Unless it brings you some form of enjoyment,

Your best course of action is to duly avoid it:

To ride life's current you must be buoyant.



Look around you, at whoever you've got,

At who you respect, at who you do not.

Who you listen to co-writes your plot.



You keep imagining heroes outside yourself,

But you've done so much - so much so well.

You're the greatest hero in the story we tell.



Realize that you are an example,

Not of more than you can handle,

But of being suited, being ample.



What speaks to the very depths of your soul?

How does that relate to your current role?

Where can they come together as a whole?



No one wants to be told what to do,

So give them the freedom to choose

Without the language of win or lose.



You are as healthy as your own good sense

To turn away from what is far too intense

And toward what makes you feel blessed.



Like a flower sprouting some thorns,

Once in awhile, abandon your norms.

You are not the one who conforms.



If all those are your source of pride,

Who then are you here, deep inside?

This is someone you should come find.



Despite all of your many proven talents,

Things fall apart when you lose balance,

So don't just pounce at every challenge.



There is a funny thing about advice -

Whether it's given to teach or entice,

You won't hear it the same way twice.



You could ask, but you should just get going.

Any benefits that might come from knowing,

May fade because of what you'd be slowing.



You already know, to finish you have to start,

But too much rush is another way to thwart.

Bit by bit, you chip away at the hardest part.



Your strength's potential is unfathomable,

Yet you have limits that are quite factual.

Thus you are a mystery - you are magical.



Do you know how to be your own advocate?

Not to be content with what seems adequate?

To treat yourself as self-respect's graduate?



Your daily routines don't need to be precise.

They need to save you from thinking twice

About what you need to live your best life.



You have attained many, and that is nice.

But goals are beneath the level of your life.

You can be riding flow and channeling light.



After that, then what will you do?

What's gotten gets forgotten soon.

Waves rise without trying to move.



This is your chance - not to feel cheated,

Or tell them how you need to be treated,

But to stop patterns from being repeated.



You know enough to get this right -

Not the opposite of wrong, not quite,

But the way that lets in more light.



Even if this isn't as simple as greed,

Another one is the last thing you need.

Ending your chase means more time freed.



You've preferred things to be a certain way,

But what happens when life brings change?

Every bit of your own resilience will stay.



Life does not announce or explain

The rules that come with each age,

So treat each as a clue-based game.



Setting personal parameters is a talent

That levity will help to keep in balance.

Find laughter between each challenge.



Right now, it is less important to be heard

And more important to be true to your word;

You may have to put yourself second or third.



Your limits are one of the most trustworthy

Guides you've brought on this life journey,

Pointing out where rest leads to recovery.



Enough time without rest will turn you numb,

So start letting some things remain undone:

Let the pieces, not your peace, succumb.



This time, just leave it a mess.

This time, just let there be less.

This time, don't you just say yes.



You may wonder if there's a solution in sight.

You may feel like you've lost all your might.

Deep inside, you know the future is bright.



Here's how to know this path is correct:

Each step gives you a mixture of content

And a yearning for whatever comes next.



Real reasons do their best to evade

Being at all dramatically portrayed.

Trust what doesn't seek to persuade.



When you get real rest, you awaken

Without feeling alarmed or shaken:

How much time has no-rest taken?



It has come for you, like it or not.

It is here, not for what you've got,

But because of all you've thought.



If you just need a bit of relief or laughter,

It helps to think of what could come after

To decide for yourself what truly matters.



No one can tell you whether to fight or flee.

Only you get to decide what's an emergency.

Respond to every raised alarm consciously.



Even if hysteria wants to drag you along,

Quick responses will begin to feel wrong:

The best thing you can offer is your calm.



There is a rhythm to what you're doing

That accelerates what's already moving

And attracts whatever you're pursuing.



Worrying about what someone else will say

Is like worrying if the wind will go away.

Opinions and light breezes are here to stay.



Were you supposed to be the hero all alone?

To do the whole entire thing on your own?

That is a children's tale you have outgrown.



What would you say inspires you the most?

When do you find yourself fully engrossed?

How much more of you could you devote?



When do you fall into feeling provoked?

Is it right after you've given the most?

Could you try a much lighter approach?



The moment you feel life's not fair,

Or that someone ignored your prayer,

Is the chance to be more self-aware.



Whether it's a choice or a retreat,

Much needed rest or overdue sleep,

Depends on the intention you keep.



They may be panicking. Don't get lured.

There is always another way, be assured,

Even if that way hasn't yet fully matured.



Be strategic about when you stand up.

Or you won't be taken seriously enough.

Deliberately is the way to get it done.



Who already knows your next move?

How can that information be used?

Could this also work to benefit you?



Your greatest asset is navigation -

The ability to map this situation

To reach your desired destination.



You deserve a little time to be lazy,

To act as you wish, even a bit crazy.

Let yeses and nos become maybes.



It's healthier to be more irreverent,

Less bound to preexisting sentiment,

Free to explore what's not so evident.



Do you know how to give yourself a break?

If not, then maybe it's time for you to train

In what it will take to take the stress away.



You have so many tools at your disposal.

As aspects of you, not one can be stolen.

So you yourself are the toolbox to open.



Could you practice not being perfect?

Interrupt your own endless circuit?

Decide work is no longer working?



If what you love is to be of service,

Then why does it need to be perfect?

Of your intentions are you certain?



Ask yourself if you have truly had enough.

Give yourself permission to say you give up.

Life exists to find and do what you love.



Let the rules be raw materials for you.

Bend them into something entirely new,

Not to go anywhere but directly through.



There are times for exceptions. 

Maybe this could be one then?

If you redefine your function.



Like doing a cleaning of the seasonal kind,

Move boxed-up thoughts around in your mind

And see what surprising treasures you find.



You just must keep inviting more change

Even if that means yet another rearrange.

Either way, nothing ever stays the same.



Mastering skills that bring you no joy

Is giving a hopeful child the wrong toy.

Mastery without love is misery's ploy.



In all this noise, the answer is quiet.

That's why you can't hear it quite yet.

Can you create the necessary silence?



If you truly agree that there's too much,

What are you doing to say that's enough?

Does your tenderness need to turn tough?



You've been offered what you don't want:

Be clear it's something you've already got.

You'll end up having to do this quite a lot.



Concern that becomes unrest, becomes worry,

And too much intensity makes things blurry:

You need to slow yourself down (in a hurry).



You've dealt with it too long. You're riled.

Do something to help you forget for awhile.

You'll come back ready to win with a smile.



Circumstances aren't the actual problem -

They only wear the words we put on them.

Challenge what's "important" more often.



You might be impressively accurate.

But what would be truly miraculous

Is if you took on no more after this.



Knowing what you need to do

Doesn't mean you'll execute:

Do you sincerely want to?



How you'll get there, you'd never believe.

The path does more than curve and weave -

It actually turns you into who you'll need.



The goal does not have to be big. You do.

Rise to meet it. Become. Show and prove.

You are not the catch. You're the pursuit.



Everything can serve as a burden or a tool,

Even things that don't normally get used:

Everything's in how everything's viewed.



Whether you choose to doubt or trust,

You will become exactly who you must,

So let all your commentary be hushed.



No point letting yourself feel cornered,

Or wondering which is faster or shorter,

There is one direction for you: forward.



What if you can't think your way through?

What if this time, this isn't all up to you?

What if quietly waiting is all you can do?



What happens when what's given is tainted?

Or just makes things more complicated?

Return to what you've already created.



You're right to be defensive about your time.

But it's healthier to focus on the other side -

Where you're doing exactly as you decide.



How wonderful they're so at ease around you

Enough to tell you what they need you to do.

Can you inform them they must be confused?



Looking at all the results from before,

What can you predict will be in store

If you return to them for even more?



All you can do is respond to this

As soon as you become aware of it

With exactly the actions that fit.



If you're awakened by the sound of an attack,

Sometimes your only real option is to react.

So put what you know for sure at your back.



Everything in you might refuse,

And swear this you'll never do!

Give yourself time to diffuse.



What you do may bring you popularity,

But how you do it becomes your legacy.

Can you reach another level of integrity?



First, you got inspired with a mighty vision.

Then, you used that power to make decisions.

Now, you yourself will undergo redefinition.



Let these waves spill over your edges.

Make the uncomfortable concessions.

This is how your awareness stretches.



But at some point you need to say no

To carry everything you already hold

And get it where it all needs to go.



The comfort of having an exit plan

Can make drama easier to withstand

And turn harsh desert into soft sand.



Can you not hear what your gut is saying?

Is that because something loud is playing?

What can help to hear what it's conveying?



As many revisions as it's going to take.

That's how willing you have to be today.

But let your gut decide what must change.



Let this be your permission/reminder:

Let your changes get subtler and finer

So your range grows lower and higher.



Be as willing to cling as to let go,

And you'll almost certainly know

When which decision is apropos.



You may already have made up your mind,

But this may not be the opportune time,

So work on other details of your design.



The things that over time don't change,

Are the things around which to rearrange,

The bonds your heart chooses to maintain.



You can't know anyone else's inner world,

Until their actions reveal something more.

So open up your senses, but do not absorb.



For some, words serve as a clever disguise

But your intuition can feel all they hide.

Without being told, you already realize.



There may be no quick cleaning of this mess,

But that is no good reason to invite stress.

Despite the conditions, still do your best.



This is not bad news or words meant to hurt,

But remember things could always be worse,

So stop right here - be grateful for this first.



Is this something you can outgrow?

What can you do in order to know?

Do you sense life has more to show?



If you busy yourself with too many issues,

Then you may end up even more confused:

Focus on what can actually be improved.



This ability you have to rebound,

Has already made you renowned,

Royalty that need not be crowned.



Regardless of whether you require proof,

Your name has traveled farther than you,

So if you wish to inspire, you already do.



Are you following examples that have lasted?

Or ones inexperienced judges call fantastic?

Against what are your examples contrasted?



Do you enter new places consciously?

If not, could you get some training?

Awareness of self in each space is key.



Whether you think of it as something you eat,

Or where you lay back and kick up your feet,

You are long overdue and deserving of a treat.



Fatigue is a note from the body, mind or soul

That there's a thing you harbor, hide or hold

You need to look for, loosen from and let go.



Expect interests, just like seasons, to turn.

But as long as you can find more to learn,

Keep growing here - don't be concerned.



Despite what behaviors everyone displays,

People function in every imaginable way.

Remember this, it's the cure for naivete.



If you assume they will treat you the same,

Then you will only have yourself to blame

If you return without having made a change.



Your ideas versus the ways they're formed,

If you didn't know, consider yourself warned:

They make each other from what you absorb.



Once you get these basic things covered,

It will be like getting windows shuttered:

In the storm, no damage will be suffered.



When you tend to what seems so basic,

You're perfecting part of your mosaic

And making future mastery formulaic.



Where are you when you feel most effective?

Somewhere subpar or somewhere selective?

Somewhere open or somewhere protected?



No substance, not even one as basic as food

Ever by itself causes you to feel any good -

Perspective is what makes fire from wood.



When the offering sounds too complex,

Or too specific about what comes next,

It is yours to both receive, then reject.



When the stories start getting too grand,

Your feet may have likewise left the land:

Return to where you can make your stand.



In the world of your own imaginary land,

Dream as much detail as you possibly can:

Experience all the realities you command.



Deciding between being blunt or subtle?

Consider how you'll handle the rebuttal,

And whether either will sidestep trouble.



If complications arrive all of a sudden,

Prevent them from growing by the dozen:

Use decisiveness rather than discussion.



If they prefer to wrap up their world,

While you're wanting yours to unfurl,

Doesn't collaborating sound absurd?



Find out as much as possible beforehand

To adjust necessary parts of your plan:

Adapt and still make it turn out grand.



Before you set out to follow their example,

Were their reasons for doing it all ample?

If not, you are taking too big of a gamble.



Stories filled with stories are as dangerous

To your time as rain is to metal that rusts:

The more layers, the less there is to trust.



You must remember to take no offense,

But to perceive people this way instead:

They need clarity on what you meant.



If they're accustomed to giving one answer,

You're dealing with an incapable commander:

Relieve them of all the work you can handle.



You won't be able to say when it will stop

Until your silent resistance finally drops

And you find the right mindset to adopt.



Some will participate by criticizing,

Many more, without even realizing.

Leave both below and keep climbing.



What feels like it happened all of a sudden,

Or seems like it was here and then wasn't

Is an unexpectedly delayed repercussion.



Your strength will eventually drain out,

Your success will sometimes go without.

Your love will overflow every drought.



Your determination will make doubt its fool,

Master enough skills to start its own school

And free your imagination from owing proof.



Could you give yourself this one gift?

Regardless of whether you need the lift?

Remember you are loved and cherished.



You forgive yourself,

Which restores health,

Which grows true wealth.



Be kinder to yourself, even after mistakes,

Especially when you normally think disdain.

You deserve a much wider positive range.



You've grown a tangibly caring essence

By becoming more and more attentive

As you realize you're simply precious.



Regardless of where your thoughts cling,

You have done genuinely marvelous things.

So love yourself with more understanding.



You'd do well to try this little experiment:

Tell your worst secret to your plant or pet.

Their reaction is called being truly present.



Where else is anything but here and now?

What else is present, and if so, then how?

Why not pick the thoughts you'll allow?



Do you possess all the energy you require?

Does a better source need to be acquired?

Do any fading sources need to be retired?



Are you already preparing to be uptight?

Are you assuming you're headed to fight?

Rather than headed up to higher heights?



Can you do things in such a way

So as to thank yourself for today

And treat this as if it were play?



How do you keep your energy flowing?

How do you keep your light glowing?

How do you keep your growth going?



What do you do to thank yourself

For a life with this much health

And heaps of friendship wealth?



Treasure the friends you can laugh with

And challenge in brutal battles of wit.

If you have even one nearby, you win.



It's alright to yearn for your next break,

Even if that's what gets you through today.

How much more easily a new mindset waits!



Worrying about what you're going to do

Is actually and factually of no real use:

All you control is your overall mood.



No matter how unpleasant the situations,

Or how mesmerizing each new sensation,

You decide how they fit your vibration.



Is your focus on the wrong piece?

Is that blocking what you perceive

By putting you behind your beliefs?



That incredible goal is now behind you.

Something new awaits for you to choose.

What past gains are you willing to lose?



Do you understand what's happening here?

Is your generosity ignoring what is clear?

Avoiding the facts is another form of fear.



Needing answers right this moment

Is a demand that should be noted:

Why can patience not be chosen?



When you're busy thinking of other things,

Take a moment to cherish what life brings

When you're simply riding atop its wings.



What if you're generally thinking too much

About facts, figures and fantasies and such?

Is thinking really your will's clever crutch?



Who can say what will happen after?

Can you just skip to the next chapter?

You're here for now, so try laughter.



If you're taking care of yourself

Just so you can be of more help,

No: you're the reason to be well.



Not everything has to be for results.

What things do you do just because?

Could having fun be reason enough?



If you keep needing to ask permission,

Your level of power there is deficient:

You belong where you hold dominion.



You cannot force what naturally flows.

All you can do is be where it will go.

Put yourself downhill of what rolls.



What do you know about who you listen to?

As important as content is their core value:

Have they set out to be right or to be true?



You are not here to clean the world's mess.

You are not here to battle or defeat stress.

You are here to meet love and forgiveness.



Which friend has the biggest reputation?

Counting both their climb and duration?

How do you both honor your affiliation?



Which friend are you constantly helping?

Which one always offers the overwhelming?

How could you both rise above delving?



Lessons that include historical asides,

Often carry a past adorned with pride.

What sounds very simple is also wise.



Are you sure your success isn't a threat?

You can bother those you haven't even met

Grow a compassion you may not need yet.



Those you put around you are everything,

Not just for all the talents they can bring,

But for all they prevent from happening.



You don't need to spend energy keeping track.

Something in you knows, not needing facts

When it's done defending, and strikes back.



There is a tone to strife and a tone to peace:

One fluctuates most - one changes the least.

One gets you to be loud, one gets you to be.



It may look to others like you're retreating,

But their opinion is nothing you're needing.

You're actually in this. What are you feeling?



Other methods are temporary or bogus:

Love and forgiveness will let you focus

On the present things that matter most.



Did it seem there was a deeper meaning

To all the things that were proceeding?

Let it come to you instead of reaching.



Despite how you feel about what you get,

This is merely a return on an investment:

How much of what? That is the question.



Vague wishes are granted, specific ones too:

Be clear about what you want to come true.

Your intention is not something to dilute.



You can succeed at an amazing rate.

No, it's not luck - it's mental state.

You succeed in the space you create.



How many times have you tried?

What lessons did each provide?

How many can be reapplied?



Yes, you deserve these temporary breaks,

But don't get so lulled by them you stay:

Your discipline relies on pleasure delay.



Where water overflows, it turns reckless.

Where have your thoughts all collected?

Emptiness will make you more effective.



Some feelings mean you need to disarm.

Other ones mean take a break, recharge.

Do you know which ring which alarms?



When you work hard, you forget your health.

But you can finally be your own best help.

Welcome back. Welcome back to yourself.



As the one responsible for this endeavor,

You can relax and it will be even better;

People have a way of working together.



Who can you help regroup and reconnect?

Who can you help feel especially blessed?

Who can you help take one giant breath?



Your past and your present both reflect:

You lovingly face whatever comes next,

So you will always have energy to lend.



You masterfully create space via intent.

You masterfully create time well spent.

You masterfully create today's present.



You embody a balance of levity and depth.

You embody both flexibility and strength.

You embody the raw tenacity of patience.



How much are you able to enjoy building?

As much as a bunch of engrossed children

Who prefer fun over heroes and villains?



Do you see what happens to your creativity

When you give it a hard deadline to meet?

It can turn things around instantaneously.



Are you focusing on being seen?

Or doing exactly what you mean?

Or somewhere right in between?



When you focus on what matters,

Useless thoughts swiftly scatter

As your best intentions gather.



Rather than plan, do this instead:

Dream. Dare to imagine far ahead

To feel into how this could spread.



Once again, here is what you can deduce:

No one needs the things you can produce.

Show them and you what can be cut loose.



This is not about your legacy.

Feel into your actual identity.

Drop longevity for integrity.



Why not just let it all be known?

Why not let everything be shown?

Why do you consider it your own?



Is this how you treat your light?

Do you just reflect what's inside?

Or let it shine by stepping aside?



There is no point looking that far ahead,

So leave the rest of those plans unsaid.

Focus on every way you can feel instead.



Thinking comes long after every feeling;

So whatever thoughts have you believing,

Trust what your emotions are revealing.



People who recognize and respect your voice

Are people who should be your first choice.

Reliability is what you can use at this point.



No ideas but your own are to be allowed.

Think them up until you tire yourself out,

Then sit for just as long without a sound.



You're reaching the end of this path.

How long would you like that to last?

The next is without maps or forecast.



Regardless of what is up for sale,

Whatever is packaged grows stale.

Be where you can breathe: exhale.



Your mind was not made for this -

For juggling every task life gives:

It takes so much less to fully live.



Difficulty and discomfort both know,

As does the best life has yet to show -

The key has always been to just flow.



When you love it so much... then why not?

Why bother giving time another thought?

Why not make everything but this, pause?



To be wise enough to know what you've got,

And experienced enough doing it in one spot,

Shows you love, and are beloved, quite a lot.



Some days you need to break your rules.

You need to play as your own life's fool.

What for? To see what all you're up to.



The situation calls for a different persona,

A version of you you've not met or known,

Who can easily handle what's been shown.



Since your quest is going to go on awhile,

You may as well make the journey in style

By taking on a task that makes you smile.



Looking back, you may say, "Of course!"

But from here, you may ask, "Am I sure?"

Self-reflection is your priceless resource.



Who are you doing this for... honestly?

Why do you continue on so constantly?

How much are you doing consciously?



Swimming in goals can seem more appealing

Than diving down into your deepest feeling:

So which will it be - reaching or revealing?



As you begin to get everything sorted,

It will be clear what're more important

And also where you feel most supported.



Habitual thinking limits clear thought

By cramming what is into what ought.

What fresh ideas has the day brought?



Is it the real or just a reflection?

Is it apparent or just a perception?

Is it impactful or just an impression?



Are there a few more questions to ask

So you can feel you have a firm grasp

On what is behind this ongoing task?



If you take your thoughts too seriously,

They'll turn around and start ransoming

Time for control: stay fiercely carefree.



Whether it happened or not, 

It's used up enough thought:

Move on to what you've got.



Pouring too much of yourself into this

May be putting too much into the mix:

To be clear, you may need to be swift.



Solve no problems except your own.

Let none of your flaws go unknown

As you go inwardly, honest and bold.



Whenever your thoughts get too intricate,

There's another approach more legitimate

That focuses on increment by increment.



For wherever your inner fog is thick,

Your old approach may be too quick.

Revisit your process: that's the trick.



Imagine succeeding at that whole thing.

What deep satisfaction would that bring?

None? Then to what do you still cling?



If you can do so lightly, then go ahead.

If not, go and do another thing instead.

Do things lightly and your heart is fed.



Are you making that more complicated?

Are these your strengths being activated?

Are you aware of what's being cultivated?



When you improve things little by little,

You bind together what apart was brittle:

The solution isn't easy, but it is simple.



If there are too many steps required,

In the details you'll soon get mired.

Simplicity is where to get inspired.



If you find yourself managing a process,

Ask yourself whether you feel as blessed

As when you are doing far more or less.



One approach truly matches your vibration,

While another just causes more frustration:

Pick the one that goes on daily explorations.



You're certainly allowed to complain,

But if the day is all that has changed,

Your thoughts desire to be retrained.



If they're showing you unpleasant aspects,

Consider what's in you that that reflects -

And then feel each feeling you feel next.



For as long as you want labels, have them.

But beware what they praise or condemn.

There are no labels in what you've dreamt.



To feel fulfilled or simply blessed,

Pick between presence or a process:

You can take the way that feels best.



If you unconsciously do as you're advised,

You may betray instinct to go do otherwise:

When do intuition and a moment coincide?



This time, be strong by being gentle.

The journey is energetic, not mental.

So an ease that channels is essential.



Until you find one who can fully relate,

Perhaps you should use this time to wait

Or to continue to quietly concentrate.



Sit with the urge to share this just yet.

Sit and notice what realizations you get

When you sit without needs being met.



That may not be what they're up to.

Don't just ask - consciously review

Whether or not this can continue.



This next decision calls for courage -

To face the feelings that may stir up,

And to know you do this out of love.



Even if your delivery is deemed rough,

There is a time to say that was enough.

So you can clear all unnecessary stuff.



Where there are leaders, followers form.

Where there are levels, there is a norm -

Where you find being, presence is born.



It is alright to let harsh words bubble up

In the presence of someone you can trust

To say, "Alright already, that's enough."



Do you know when you are at your best?

Then avoid the hours that feel like a test

And use that time instead to simply rest.



Your best ideas come wrapped in an emotion,

So feel all that surrounds your latest notion

Before you choose to give it your devotion.



Beyond the words for it, how does it feel?

Beyond any terminology or trendy appeal,

Can you enjoy what one moment reveals?



There is no point giving any of this a name.

As fluid as everything is, you are the same.

The only constant thing in you is Change.



Without giving it the words, let it speak.

Don't assume its purpose is to just teach:

Does it tell of something you can reach?



Go in together, or else not at all,

So neither will suffer a lone fall,

And you both become invincible.



Whether it is what you normally allow,

Or you feel as if you barely know how,

Speak in a way that speaks to you now.



Take a moment to look so far up the road

That you barely recognize it as your own

Then use this perspective to pack and go.



All that you have, and have done, is good.

But you can do less - and yes, you should

By doing all you can - not all you could.



Shed thoughts of doing it right or wrong:

Whether or not your instincts felt strong,

You've been doing this perfectly all along.



Go, whether you get invited there or not.

Go because a voice within says you ought.

Go without a battle needing to be fought.



Just sit and listen to everything going on.

Quietly take in what's been here all along.

Simply and sincerely listen: don't respond.



There's a good reason that mattered to you -

Your core values are trying to break through:

So follow them to what they already pursue.



Even if you prefer not using your power,

Your life journeys, both inner and outer,

Can benefit from you being a bit louder.



As much a matter of timing as of trust -

You came here to abound, not to adjust:

Shed what you can, keep what you must.



Even a fancy invitation to get riled up

Still isn't valid or interesting enough

To step outside the light of self-love.



Even if you lack proper proof to go on,

Your can keep your inner vision strong:

Thank your patience for lasting so long.



It's not in any information you'll find.

Knowing doesn't happen in your mind.

Thoughts tell tales (feelings never lie).



You may think it's good enough like this,

But that relaxed attitude doesn't quite fit:

Now's the time to wholeheartedly commit.



Ask, if you need anything repeated.

Ignore how the question is treated.

Do it to get everything completed.



Give things your own special meaning

By making a milestone of your reason:

Keep following your favorite feeling.



In the face of the upcoming unknown,

You are actually being invited to grow

As you let what is to be, simply unroll.



Though still far enough to remain a blur,

It is coming, whether or not you concur:

You can take action before things occur.



Once this goal is a trophy on your shelf,

Will you be in pursuit of something else?

Isn't it enough to just fully be yourself?



And what of this obsession with loyalty?

As though it commands a place of royalty

Anywhere above living your life joyfully?



As long as you're waiting on someone else

To decide whether or not you've done well,

You're one more day from being yourself.



Unlikely friends are perhaps the best kind

Because of how they so beautifully remind

You: Life begins when your plans unwind.



This opportunity may not feel so opportune

But it's here along with its very own muse.

The only thing left right now is to choose.



Let the words you use - every single one

Remind you that you are here having fun

And that you truly deserve a "Well done!"



What enters the ears, needn't exit the mouth.

But it does need to leave you via some route:

So tilt your head to let all of it fall right out.



Habits and happenings plop you in between

What you've known and where you've been:

All you can improve today is your routine.



Even when the river of goals runs dry,

You still have the real reason you try:

Go upstream and check on your Why.



Do what you can, but not unnaturally more.

Overworking is not worth working toward:

Balance and boundaries are naturally yours.



Do you need an explanation or more clarity?

These events are because of your community.

Your best life is about the company you keep.



And at some point, it is time to take control,

Time to do more than whatever you are told.

You were already able - so now, just be bold.



That thought that runs through your mind -

Is that the spending or the wasting of time?

This is the most important thing to define.



Now for the question it is time you answered.

Put aside for a moment, the need for manners:

Who can you ever be without your standards?



There is a level at which you must be met

For you to genuinely give as well as get.

Realize that they may not be here yet.



Despite all you're sure you've learned,

And anything you think you've earned,

Loving is the way you feel reaffirmed.



Think about how you want life to feel;

Then think about what today calls real,

And now imagine that as a layer to peel.



If you have assumptions, beware.

Surprises may be hiding in there:

Send them a little questionnaire.



It's all clear when you're connected -

Being swift might be more effective:

Don't be patient - just be perceptive.



Now this is a project of a different kind,

One that takes more attention than time:

You have to work on your state of mind.



Time is not something you can control,

But energy? Now this, is all your own.

Focusing it sets your whole life's tone.



You may need to back away from it slowly

Rather than quitting suddenly or wholly;

Patience is more valuable than knowing.



Telling your side of it is less effective

Than taking steps that are corrective -

Try tactics that transcend perspective.



Of course that is not your burden to bear,

Nor is it anything to now - or ever - wear.

Handle yourself with the greatest of care.



Head in a direction you've never been.

Who all you'll meet has yet to be seen.

Allies will come wherever you convene.



For this, your language needs to be direct,

And your ideas, well-organized - correct.

For this, keep all your emotions in check.



That which has a set price, has a set limit -

So there's only so much you can do with it;

That which you enjoy has a value infinite.



Neither flattery nor insult bends truth.

So let every word pass straight through.

Meanwhile, nod, continue, nod, continue.



Know what upsets your sense of stability

Versus what makes you feel like nobility.

Only one lets you reach your tranquility.



Despite everything you are told or shown,

Keep going - this journey is all your own.

The next turn has room for just you alone.



Warnings work from wisdom or worry,

So stop starting to strategize or scurry.

Be still and nothing will ever be blurry.



You're the only one who truly knows:

It's time for all that to draw to a close.

Trust whatever your intuition shows.



Both bright and dark stories abound.

With which does your heart resound?

Decide on one, hurry up and rebound.



You immediately improve your health

By remembering this one thing well:

You can change no one but yourself.



This is not about what it can produce, 

But about what it does for you, yes you.

Does it give you time as well as truth?



Even when you consider it idle chitchat,

Don't spend any more time doing that.

Challenge yourself to follow a format.



Just as moisture helps make good ink,

Don't listen to the thoughts you think

Until you've had more water to drink.



Though at first it may be misconstrued,

Even to the point of being labeled rude,

Decide your day - or it will decide you.



When trying to figure out what's true,

Rule out the one that categorizes you.

Trust the one with time-tested proof.



Let this remind that they are outside of you,

Which is that much father from your truth.

And you have better things to do than duel.



Their advice about what you need to become

Is nothing to which you need ever succumb.

At this moment, you are perfect as this One.



As you travel across your inner land,

Are you noticing as much as you can?

Aren't you enough? Isn't this grand?



To survive this place, do you have to strain?

Does the weather here ever turn inhumane?

If so, take the faster way across this terrain.



Don't say you are - show yourself.

This regifts you your own health.

Replace explanation with stealth.



You can only be as clear as you can be.

Once you've done so, forget to worry,

And remember who you need to please.



Let this reminder remind you of the fact:

Sometimes, based on where you arrive at,

The only way forward is a few steps back.



The only opportunities that turn out great?

The opportunities that you yourself create.

The opportunities no one else can activate.



When you need someone to cooperate,

The right one may be hard to locate.

Yes, exactly: all you can do is... wait.



Whatever you're experiencing is only half.

In the end, you're guaranteed a good laugh.

So why not also enjoy here where you're at!



Even after you've tried every single option,

Your attempt can still ultimately be a flop.

Should the goal or your tactics be dropped?



This time, insist on being fully understood.

Otherwise the result may be a true falsehood.

Pressing the point will do some genuine good.



Some consider every surprise a trap.

Others are just always on the attack.

You, take everything in as feedback.



Who else knows what you "need to become"

In order to get the most difficult part done?

The most accurate answer is, in fact, no one.



Enough of all this thinking. Just do the work.

Think of thinking as a cleverer way to shirk.

If you need ideas, stay busy and they'll perk.



Gentle? Yes. Fragile? No, you are not.

And though your mind has created a lot,

You shatter useless patterns of thought.



Does it feel like you've reached your limit?

This is pointing to something in your spirit.

A core need is speaking: do more than hear it.



Whether the advice sounds flexible or firm,

It is no shortcut to what you have to learn -

You're the one to whom you must now turn.



It's going to take far longer if go that way.

You'll have to backtrack and endure delay.

For now, on this less gratifying path, stay.



Presented with two options, don't fret.

Think of them as scraps someone has left.

Refuse both. A real option is coming yet.



A vocation is a thing you do for income.

But an avocation creates its own outcome.

What calls you for neither money nor fun?



If it's now twice as much as it was before,

Maybe you need to do twice as much more

Of what makes you feel safe and secure.



Why do you cling to that outdated role?

(Yes, even when it was new, it was old.)

Reimagine yourself for potential untold.



If the journey brings you to a gatekeeper,

Take the other path, that although steeper

Is, in terms of life energy, much cheaper.



Take this simple way - not that easy one:

You'll find both deep connection and fun

Where you do more than get things done.



It's too complicated, almost like a maze,

With one exit, but many misleading ways.

Climb up, over, out - simplify your days.



No one knows how to do this better than you,

So cancel your search for any self-substitute.

You are the only one who can tell what's true.



Having an awareness of what each thing is for

In your ever-expanding, energetic repertoire

Is how to do more than you ever have before.



Your focus needs to be completely here.

What you've built before, let disappear.

This is a new level in your atmosphere.



If they are inclined to follow a herd,

It's unlikely your needs can be heard.

Waiting for them is therefore absurd.



You've learned your lesson to the letter?

Well, there is no gatekeeper or checker:

The only way to prove it is to do better.



Take time to let what is tight unfurl.

Take a step back from your busy life swirl.

Take a moment to take in this beautiful world.



Serving can give you an unexpected boost

Or serving can leave your energy reduced.

Try serving the ones who try serving too.



Be mindful if you catch yourself looping

Because of events that have you stooping:

Give them a far lower-priority grouping.



Frustration always tries to rush its case;

Fascination arrives with far more grace.

So slow your reaction. Notice your face.



You know that actions are louder than words.

Also know what's spoken is swiftly unheard

Unless you ask, listen, and wait long enough.



Most are just talking - always remember this.

Thank kind words, forgive ones that don't fit.

Always remember - you bring your own bliss.



Focus on one thing this time - only one,

Not just in order to get some goal won,

But so something potent can be begun.



A heated conversation will eventually burn.

Douse conversations that lack true concern,

And to your own sincerest subjects return.



There is an expression, "Make it plain."

"Be clear and concise," means the same.

Uncomplicate words for the entire day.



To hold is as valuable as to gain.

To risk is as noble as to remain.

To know which to do is a game.



Repeating yourself is far from teaching,

And much more akin to deafly preaching.

Must you disturb those who are sleeping?



Search for common ground to communicate.

Don't search for so long that you end up late

To you and your common sense's daily date.



You win awards for grasping and reaching.

You receive praise for risking and leaping.

You only enjoy by pausing and breathing.



Who you are - work on who you are, solely.

And since you are never "finished" wholly,

It is best to work on who you are - slowly.



Your primary concern needs to be your time.

It is something you fully possess, not "find."

Thinking about anything else? Explain why.



What makes you strong, also makes you weak

Because it lets you assume you have no need:

Get feedback even when you feel fine indeed.



There's a story being told, consciously or not,

Being repeated regardless of whether it ought.

This is something to be leveraged, not fought.



"I'm worse than everyone at this." So what?

You can change that situation easily enough

With a little bit more focus and self-love.



You don't need too much time, however

You should use body and mind together

And there'll be no obstacles whatsoever.



As you surpass needing to ask permission,

You're beginning to live into your vision

By using it alone to make each decision.



You can continue going the pace you were,

Or else go so fast each day becomes a blur.

You can both let - and make - things occur.



It's time to honor your personal history,

Not by feeling regret or even sympathy -

But by using it to plan your next victory.



Build every year according to a structure

With infinite amounts of awe and wonder,

That turns age into an irrelevant number.



Every aspect of yourself has some function.

Investigate each after a brief introduction.

Odd as it sounds, let it lead the discussion.



Doing the same thing over and over

Is the surest way to only get older:

To your inner world, get exposure.



You're never kept where you don't wish to be.

First, you'll find your way out non-physically,

Then you'll shift things to match your reality.



Whether or not it makes any external sound,

Each thing has a vibration that is profound.

Can you harmonize with everything around?



Being as you choose to be,

Or as you are, completely

Is all there ever is, you see.



Whether it is newborn or elderly,

Everything is made up of energy,

Knowing this, vibrate effectively.



If your perspective is too broad, pause.

Focus on a single, down-to-earth cause.

Make use of a few key real-world laws.



Your body is trying to speak to you: hear.

Even without words, its messages are clear

As you consider each and every organ dear.



Whatever you need is here right now:

Answers, questions - all you'll allow.

By you consciously noticing, is how. 



Your voice, whether audible or not,

Is the greatest treasure you've got.

Should you listen to it? Yes, a lot.



Consider this the end of that old cycle.

You're a leader, with or without a title.

Living into this is no less than vital.



Being so open and abstract is admirable,

But it's time to do something graspable.

This is the time for you to be rational.



It's no question - you've made an impact.

Once you just know, accept and trust that,

Return to getting your own self-care intact.



You can tackle one problem, not them all.

Broad issues have no answer, focus small.

If asked to do more than this, gladly stall.



Your energy can move you all over the place,

But there is something to be said for grace -

For surrendering into simplicity's embrace.



Opening for everything can duly overwhelm.

So put guards at the gates of your own realm,

Letting in those who love letting you be well.



If you can be this, you can be anything else.

If you can be still, you can arrive at health.

If you can be grateful, you can enjoy wealth.



You give naturally when you are at ease -

Sharing your time, energy, and expertise.

Generosity is something calm guarantees.



There's no telling where you're going next,

Especially when you neither stop to expect,

Nor bother to let yourself get truly vexed.



It's alright to feel each of these emotions.

Their idea of "normal" is what's broken.

Be every bit of the you you've chosen.



A perfect way to begin is uncertainly.

From here, stop. Then, deeply breathe.

Your body now has a map to certainty.



If all your options repeat that cycle,

It's time to give the pattern its title:

An unarguably accurate name is vital.



There's far more here than you'll ever need;

Far from being an invitation toward greed,

It's one hint there's far more inside to feel.



Your deepest success is soundly guaranteed

When you bravely brave the space between

What you do and do not believe you need.



It will happen right when it's supposed to,

So shift your efforts into something new,

And there behold your next breakthrough.



What easily arrives, may easily depart

As things end the same way they start;

And so you must lead with your heart.



Not yet - that's all you need to know.

Not yet - trust without being shown.

Not yet - there is still more to grow.



"What you lack" is a worthless token.

You cannot fix what was never broken.

You are both the voyage and the ocean.



Whether you take the path or stray,

Whether you go by night or by day,

You'll meet yourself along the way.



There's a deeper state of being, deeper still,

A current that runs deeper than power will,

A depth in you asking to be felt, not filled.



First, remember you're in need of rest.

Next, think of which way to do it best.

Now, put all these thoughts to the test.



Celebrate when you reach a peak.

And before the next one you seek,

Invite every part of you to speak.



Distinguish the outside distractions of noise

From what's speaking with your inside voice.

Quieting each, you'll make your best choice.



You're the only one who's going to know,

At least for now, until it all finally shows,

Because even what you don't plant grows.



Be doing the most important thing right now,

The thing that only you know exactly how.

All other obligations? Immediately disavow.



Work or worry, but you cannot do both.

To one or the other, make a little oath:

Day by day you will see to its growth.



In that one area, make a different decision.

And keep making it, under close supervision.

This part of your story is undergoing revision.



What excites you? What gives you that thrill?

What do you do heedless of the outcome still?

What is it that where others won't, you will?



Your mind is prone to speed up and race,

But this is a time for it to stay in place:

It is time to give it specifics, not space.



If you don't already do so regularly,

Tend to your body's needs patiently.

It has been trusting you faithfully.



Years, minutes, months, seconds, days?

These are nothing but untimely names.

Your each and every Now is the same.



You assume you're listening, but stop:

Are you over there in another thought?

Come back here to the now you've got.



Even where it touches the body and brain,

Enjoy the caress of life's constant change,

And whatever you wish to keep, maintain.



There is no more to be gained from it.

Spend less time on that, more on this -

Less feeling tasked, more feeling bliss.



After each time you go out exploring,

Maybe you could do a bit more sorting:

Was that a gift or a beautiful warning?



Operating at that level takes an energy

That also takes more time for recovery.

Practice switching to each immediately.



It is best if they get there on their own, so

Leave them options then leave them alone,

Using words that make them feel at home.



That this is a lot - is indisputable.

So when you forget, it's excusable:

That your life is so very beautiful.



Just for this - choose your every word.

Sculpt exactly what's going to be heard.

Speak to those you want to feel stirred.



Saying more is worse than saying less.

Keep some extra air inside your chest

To answer what they might ask next.



You're right about what's going to happen.

Your unseen senses are in no way lacking.

You're aware of what you need to fasten.



Who knows which is the best care for you?

Who knows whether you had a breakthrough?

Who knows what you're actually about to do?



Not "what they need," but what you can give,

Because once it's given, you still have to live.

Let your schedule be a container, not a sieve.



It is not something to take too personally,

Nor to be sure of with too much certainty:

Sometimes some people act - accidentally.



If they're in pain, don't expect too much;

Or, expect nothing, so as not to begrudge.

It's good to let them know they're enough.



Lack is right here - opportunity is too.

Where you focus makes one come true,

Put your choosing power to careful use.



Think what will happen if you focus on that,

Where your time will go versus where it's at.

No judgment needed - just a plan of attack.



You've seen what you can do in one year,

Perhaps without even trying to get here.

What if you got truly focused and clear?



Above all, you need to keep it brief.

Whatever is too full becomes weak.

Give them time to think and speak.



As fast as you were going to get it done,

You now need to go from a walk to a run

In order to arrive there as the chosen one.



Acceptance, presence, and responsibility -

You'll win today with at least these three,

And tomorrow too, if you add humility.



Given circumstance and environment,

Your feelings actually all make sense:

All you need to uproot is impatience.



Consistent effort, consistent progress.

Every day, just do what you deem best.

Every day, choose what you'll do next.



Of what you've done or have tried,

Let the useless fall by the wayside,

And do more where you're inspired.



There is a reason you procrastinate:

Your intuition is asking you to wait

Before it shows where to accelerate.



As if it were perfectly and exactly timed,

You're becoming exactly what's required,

So focus on nothing but feeling aligned.



It's nothing you need to dredge up or drag,

Nor do you need to go enroll in some class:

You're searching for what you already have.



When did you last enjoy a bottomless breath,

Born deep down in the belly, not in the chest,

One that opened you up to whatever is next?



Regardless of where you feel strain or strife,

Regardless of that, you have a beautiful life,

Regardlessly going so very completely right.



Start spotting your next climb,

Preparing yourself deep inside:

Be sometimes wily, always wise.



What about if you don't (...for now)?

Change will find its way here anyhow,

So realize what you're really all about.



Fit all of this into your chosen context,

Not so you can plan each and every step,

But to figure out which path feels best.



Let this remind you to revisit your goals,

Because the joy and beauty of growing old,

Is celebrating everything will be outgrown.



Even at life's most unexpected turns,

You get to set your own mind's terms,

So listen, but decide, and remain firm.



Some things are not here to serve you,

Except to point away from what's true.

Go the opposite way in deep gratitude.



Stop keeping track of weekly events -

Start keeping track of daily strengths.

Keep doing this from here on hence.



Some go around in search of more struggle,

Others in search of one more ball to juggle.

Search instead for good reasons to chuckle.



Everyone loves your warm way of being

Because it is embracing and yet freeing,

And stays loving even when disagreeing.



When you choose to fight, be resolved

To make full use of everyone involved.

In other words, fight fully or not at all.



To not take the whole thing seriously

Is unwise. Look at this more curiously.

Beware of lingering here so luxuriously.



Take today to improve your own process.

How? First, sift out what's utter nonsense.

Then, figure out where you need access.



Would you let yourself change your dream?

Or would that challenge who you've been?

Should you care what achievements mean?



Help is all around you - start to notice.

The seemingly farthest may be closest.

All you have to do is shift your focus.



It's not that you need to do this alone,

But these ideas should be all your own

Since this next part is the cornerstone.



When someone happens to overstep,

You just politely, firmly intercept

And direct whatever happens next.



There is power in one open-ended question,

Far more so than in asking with suggestions:

Learn things they never planned to mention.



Your vital contrasts have gotten grayed:

To return from where you have strayed

Some permanent changes must be made.



Streamline your complicated systems

Into ones that'll endure the distance

Throughout your life's conditions.



Be it low and slow or high and fast,

Your pace is yours, no judgment cast.

And it can change once you've asked.



Trust your first instinct this time.

It knows more than a busy mind

By sensing more things outside.



Whether toward good or bad they swing,

Those circumstances don't mean a thing

Beyond what interpretations you bring.



What works for them might not for you.

It is not about entirely different truths -

Meaning needs timing (to be of any use).



Keep going, until it becomes second nature,

Until it gets imprinted as normal behavior.

In regards to this, you are your own maker.



It's a layer, for now, to avoid stirring up.

At least for now, let this part be enough.

For now, just sip from the top of this cup.



If today were the last day you'd do this,

Would you just as eagerly dive right in?

Or is there something else you'd begin?



Forget about legacy or some high ideal.

The only question is: how do you feel?

Because, you see, nothing else is real.



In truth, this crisis is all about control,

Which does not exist outside your own

Ability to act knowing all you know.



This is not about what they are doing wrong.

This is about you overreaching to feel strong.

So where do you believe your focus belongs?



Your whole self is attuning to consistency.

Everything wants to align with everything.

Where is this movement already benefiting?



No more stories, not one story more.

Let them become a thing you ignore.

Free of them you can actually explore.



Of those who take that path, what happens?

Do they end up with a greater life balance?

Are you noticing the gift or its wrapping?



There is only so much you can handle

At one time, so what can you cancel?

Put more energy into fewer channels.



Maybe you should just let things be,

Do as requested, and cooperatively.

But what if you responded defiantly?



Maybe you should cause a commotion,

Be the tidal wave that rolls the ocean,

Or else sail out across these emotions.



You are an abundance of existing wealth.

You have so much here, within yourself.

You have more than you've already felt.



What exactly are you expecting to happen -

That to come apart and then this to fasten?

Expect instead, to time after time gladden.



Because you have in mind a clear outcome,

And know how it helps you in the long run,

You will do exactly what needs to be done.



Pretend you have your own inner staff:

Put all of them to work on your behalf

To make sure you live, love, and laugh.



You actually already know, and exactly

What you need, quite matter-of-factly

(And it doesn't call for being crafty).



There is no great merit in endless toil,

Especially if it makes your mood spoil:

You must do more of what you enjoy.



When you do more of what you enjoy,

You radiate the most remarkable poise

And remind others they have a choice.



Are you hiding behind things here?

Are you creating safe space for fear?

Can't you make obstacles disappear?



Doing this "big" versus doing it "small,"

Presumes you already understand it all -

Treat not-yet-knowing as your windfall.



Of course you're not afraid: it's "caution"

Getting in the way of you being awesome.

Enough of the excuses already. Blossom!



Spread your energy out into the world,

Out past everything thus far observed -

Imagine your wingspan fully unfurled.



You don't need to know the way forward.

You need to keep your thoughts in order.

You need to keep your energy supported.



Assuming you know all you think you do

Is a recipe for a stale and unsavory stew -

What can a little fresh uncertainty brew?



Try it again, before you say no.

Try it once more, so you know.

Try it once more, and then go.



What do you think about things today?

Are these thoughts likely to go away?

How long are they welcome to stay?



The sight or sound or thought may tempt

You to react. But you are hereby exempt.

Center yourself in yourself to preempt.



Check to see if you feel at all trapped,

Or if into it all you've gotten wrapped.

Free yourself. You don't have to adapt.



This is simply what you've been dealt

For the moment. How has it all felt?

It can soon be where you once dwelt.



Keep going, toward this thing's horizon.

Keep going, what's there'll be surprising.

Keep going - you'll increasingly enliven.



Once you've updated your own set of views

To something that you consciously choose,

You won't be fazed by any amount of news.



Once you realize how depleting that is,

You'll be curious what it actually gives,

And you'll get a whole new set of skills.



The fact that they don't have what you need

Isn't meant to plant in you some bitter seed:

It's to launch you upward with greater speed.



The task may seem gargantuan,

But know that you indeed can

(because you are greater than).



When you cook it slow, it takes more time

From other things you might have in mind.

What's going to simply have to fall behind?



Now that you realize the cause,

Are you ready to actually pause?

Make deposits, not withdrawals.



Now that you've gotten to the root,

After such a conscientious pursuit,

Thank yourself for being so astute.



Knowing isn't enough. You must take action

To actually move on and to gain real traction.

Get going (this is not the time for relaxing).



Congratulations on choosing a worthy goal.

Now let's see what within you it unfolds.

This is what's most exciting to behold.



That you are here already is impressive.

But have you also been comprehensive?

Become more thorough than aggressive.



Remember, almost means not quite yet.

So let go of what you admittedly expect

And get back to work on your mindset.



Yes, there's a time this will be complete.

No, it is not something that is concrete.

Yes, it's based on you remaining upbeat.



Don't stop altogether, but do slow down.

Hear the signals coming from all around;

Respond before life chooses to expound.



If their behavior deeply unnerves,

Or you think of them all as absurd,

Your pride needed to be disturbed.



You have everything you need right here,

Even the baggage that carries those fears:

Everything is useful to help get you clear.



Once you do more than just intend,

Much more than you've ever dreamt

Awaits, so come out and meet them.



The quest is not about answers you hold,

It is about listening to stories yet untold

So that much bigger questions can unfold.



Your emotions all have their sources -

Whether from inside or outside forces.

Ask your heart which ones it endorses.



Whether or not you can forecast a win,

It's harder to back out from halfway in:

If the costs don't match up, don't begin.



Where you can learn inconceivably more,

That is the direction to redirect toward.

What you don't know has worth galore.



There is an approach that will drain you dry

Some predictable time after you start to try:

Take the approach that embraces your why.



Cherish the hard questions most of all,

The ones that make you consider a fall,

The ones that ask how you meet a wall.



You have no extra time to waste.

Is something genuinely at stake?

If so, then by all means, engage.



It is important to map out your support

To know how much time you can afford

To put into what you have to transport.



Have you considered all the scenarios,

Past the ones everyone already knows,

Where your imagination rarely goes?



Once you finish, what about entanglement?

Can you return home as easily as you went?

In other words, of your terms, be adamant.



Have all other options been exhausted?

Have you challenged your own caution?

Have you envisioned you being awesome?



Have the costs and risks been analyzed?

Have useless thoughts been neutralized?

Have all your objectives been defined?



Have you stepped away from being hectic?

Have you spent enough time in reflection?

Can you now explain your actual objective?



Is there a clear reason to head this way?

A reason you can easily, openly convey?

Then practice what you're going to say.



Some advice with ongoing worth

That may not help, but can't hurt:

Take the initiative. Be there first.



Perhaps you should leave them a way out

At the very least, one verbal escape route

So their chosen option won't be to shout.



Read your life thus far like a chronicle.

You've reached the part that is best of all -

The point when you become unstoppable.



Concentrate things into one single space

In order to leverage your mightiest traits

And keep tasks within your power's gates.



In this situation, yield a bit more room.

Invite them, almost all the way through.

They will tire out and then yield to you.



You don't have to respond or react.

Why not learn from this? Extract.

Why not keep your strategy intact?



There is a lot to learn right here -

So much to gather or commandeer

In your quest for a way that's clear.



Examine everything so as not to overextend -

Especially where you've asked others to lend.

It may be that your timetables need to bend.



What can you personally do to shift one

Aspect of the interconnected outcomes?

Put yourself there - get your task done.



There is a bit of chaos and a bit of chance.

Hone in on one piece of this vast expanse.

Fix your focus on what you can enhance.



There is a level of planning you must do,

But once you begin, cut your plans loose

And make one perfectly immediate move.



Unify your efforts under one clear decision.

That way you will feel less inner friction

As you become your own master tactician.



You've already done the work to compare:

It's secondary, so why do you focus there?

Of how you use your energy, be very aware.



Concise enough that you can say it quickly,

Simple enough to be followed, and strictly

Is how your plan can gain ground swiftly.



Can you say exactly how everything will go?

Of course the answer is always a definite no.

But when flexibility meets preparation? Oh!



Use your ideas to maneuver

Into water that's smoother

So you arrive much sooner.



Keep your body's needs well met

And it will likewise help you get

What you're working toward next.



If you worry the void is bottomless,

You need to do some reconnaissance:

It's all about your own consciousness.



Put an end to that right where it is.

That sort of thinking must get fixed.

Replace it with a fresh idea that fits.



Edit your part right out from this drama.

End it with a period instead of a comma.

Exit whenever you hear, "Once upon a..."



This is not the time for doing that.

Consider where your deadline is at.

This about the plain, simple facts.



You get it - or so you say you do.

But here's where you'll be of use:

Let them speak - just show truth.



Close your mouth one second longer

And you'll grow one degree stronger.

Listening is the best way to conquer.



What will happen is that they'll accuse.

Remaining composed is then up to you.

Power then becomes yours to choose.



If you suspect there is a plot,

But it turns out there is not,

Ask your busy mind to stop.



Sitting there, across from your frustration,

Do you feel the time and energy it's taken?

Do you feel an awareness you've awakened?



You should not speak about their plight.

To embrace their suffering is their right.

All you can do is stay respectful and light.



How does it feel when they launch words?

Does it stir anger or make something hurt?

Before you respond, how do you feel first?



If you speak based on how you feel,

Things may do the opposite of heal.

Discuss common ground that's real.



Listen past all their claims and slogans.

Hear out all their overreaching hopes -

Good can come from this if you're open.



Of course you could, you just have to want to:

You must recognize the outcome you choose,

And not let one untrained word break loose.



In this specific case, hold your tongue.

Their opinion is both naive and undone.

Composure will keep you fresh and young.



It won't work if they're busy stewing,

So go figure out what's been brewing,

Then explain the core misconstruing.



No need to overly focus on the end,

But what realization does this lend?

That you won't break if you bend?



To "blow it off," holds some hidden advice -

To do so, focus on your breathing must rise;

To do so, part of you waits on the other side.



But then who would you be without that?

So bow, curtsy, or tip your proverbial hat

To every inconvenience and verbal attack.



A skill you can use for now and hence,

Rather than play scenarios or get tense,

Prepare for the conversation via silence.



Give up on that part of your efforts

So you can give more and do better

Where you know there is treasure.



What you can accomplish through bliss

May be most remarkable because of this:

You achieve more by celebrating what is.



You are only just beginning to approach

The level you'll soon need, to encroach

On all who try to call yours their own.



In time, it will be completely apparent

That your goodness has been inherent,

Provided you remain this transparent.



Anger is a dangerous tool,

Easily making you its fool.

Careful with it - as a rule.



You're going to sit there and take it,

At least until the rest shows its face,

At which time you can spot and chase.



Today may not yet be your victory day,

But something is still going your way,

So relax and let out a quick, "Hooray."



Even entering that room full of noise,

What the power of demeanor destroys!

Carry yourself with a measure of poise.



Where today feels like you're getting less,

Your expectations have things to confess.

But be patient with them - don't press.



Do what you can in the least amount of time,

Even as the number of tasks starts to climb -

Prioritize and see which you can combine.



How much more time could you invest

Until eventually, there's only one left?

Is this a scenario you have addressed?



You may be surprised, even underwhelmed

By the power your rival never even held,

Their only use was to get you compelled.



Don't latch on to the latest highs or lows.

Like tiles in a mosaic, strokes in a fresco,

They're just part of what the whole shows.



You may have been invited to the spectacle,

But don't assume you have to attend at all.

Can you find something more preferable?



Wise choice, to opt out of that mystery,

Because some things are too enveloping

And tuck you under volumes of history.



Drawing into yourself to get more done

Is deceivingly simple, yet simply enough.

Doing so, even alone, you will have fun.



This space is a privilege to be in.

If it were a race, this is the win

You get even before you begin.



The quality of your thoughts -

What you're considering or not -

Decides the happiness you've got.



It's guaranteed to always be there -

The feeling you infuse into the air,

There is no one who can compare.



Wishing you had that

Instantly creates lack.

Amazing, all you have.



The status quo makes no sense,

Follow it to your own detriment

Or lead your own enlightenment.



It's not whether you get through to them -

But how you get through that is the gem.

You to you, what would you recommend?



Where you can be happy, you can grow.

Where you are challenged, even more so.

Therefore, there's nowhere you can't go.



That's enough discontent.

You need a suitable reset,

Or just some good rest.



Have you been here too long?

Are things still going strong?

What is your latest Because?



You cannot manage time. It comes. It goes.

Do what you dislike and it somehow slows.

Get lost in what you love and away it flows.



Upon completion, neither gossip nor gloat -

You can only manage the energy you devote

From head to toe (i.e. as above, so below).



It's not you getting upset - it's your ego.

Forget feeling snubbed, so you can grow.

You're being pruned. Believe it to be so.



This time, be angry silently

And you may get more clarity

By hearing just what's noisy.



If you were to get this one thing done,

You might be able to have a bit of fun.

How might your mind need this spun?



How long could you spend doing nothing?

How long working toward just one thing?

Neither extreme is good. Keep becoming.



Stay calm amidst waters rising quickly.

Slow down amidst panic spreading swiftly.

Stop amidst chaos coloring everything risky.



Alright then, there is no room for opinion.

The time for that was before today's mission.

Now, the task itself is your only dominion.



Pain shows you how much you didn't know

About how much your own body can undergo

As well as how much support it can forgo.



Take the deepest breath in the clearest air.

Wherever you wish to be, feel yourself there.

You are always this able to travel anywhere.



Mind the smaller bits of time in your day,

Letting fewer and fewer of them slip away

By shepherding attention when it strays.



You have a goal, and you have some dates

And therefore, progress you plan to make.

But most importantly, manage your state.



When in doubt, it's best to simplify.

The less you require, you will find,

The more you're able to recognize.



Consider it a ritual, chore, or a need,

There will always be things to clean.

Find your way in this to feel serene.



You probably won't consider it fun -

You probably won't even like to, but

Clean it all again. It has to be done.



They expect you to do exactly as they say,

But you are not exactly built in that way.

Do it as you, come disruption or dismay.



If they burden you with anything heavy,

Warn you'll need time to hold it steady.

Get to it when you are good and ready.



They need you to share their troubled state.

You need to maintain a maintainable space,

Even if that means they'll need to go away.



You can chop tasks from weeks to days

Based solely on your summoned state.

You have higher levels of being awake.



It's alright if you can't stop just yet -

Maybe it's something you need to get.

Patience with yourself is the best bet.



Down every path, there's something to learn

So don't bother second-guessing every turn.

Up ahead is where your wisdom is earned.



First, get the rest you need before you rise.

Next, get the nourishment you need inside.

Then greet the world with arms open wide.



Hurry. It's time to move things along.

One step past here is where you belong,

So you can then see a long way beyond.



Signs and symbols are limited in scope.

They just hint at the angle of the slope.

You are the one always able to say nope.



Imagine if your dream was too small.

What if you can so easily do that all?

Rouse the deepest vision you can call.



If that's what's pressing, why do this?

Because this is where your heart lives?

Then maybe shift things around a bit.



It can't irk you if you won't be troubled,

Even if into your mindfulness it tunneled

Because you have no intention to struggle.



It's good to revisit your important places,

Locations where your energy got elevated.

Mind you, they're milestones, not stations.



If the overall temperature here is cool,

And preference has not been left to you,

Generate your own heat - or just move.



While not everything must be this way,

Time is running out on this task today:

Straighten up whatever is in disarray.



Prepare, or experience the consequences.

Train before anyone is paying attention.

Get ready and you won't need defenses.



Go from the back of the mind to its front,

Of all there is to have, what do you want?

Your answer must be far from nonchalant.



Drawing deep within yourself

Benefits your overall health

And models for others, help.



Of all the things you're do busy doing,

Do you need all this non-stop moving?

Just how much of this is you proving?



You could wrap yourself up in this forever,

Or you can up and change your own weather

Or beneath your own ground, be the tremor.



To your great work, first of all,

Rising up higher after every fall.

Now go answer your inner call.



Doubt this to your own detriment:

It cannot be about their assessment.

It can only be about best alignment.



If you run out of things to say,

It is time to politely step away,

Unless you're invited to remain.



You can't be shown this, you have to live it

Because perception has five narrow limits -

Imagination does more the less you give it.



Putting the pieces together, you'll arrive.

You're already almost perfectly aligned

To receive your next great insight.



When they don't work as hard as you,

You work for them, as a general rule.

Work wisely or become history's fool.



Have they delivered what they promised?

Have they failed to, yet exuded calmness?

Have you tricked yourself this is honest?



If they believe they hold power over you,

Disconnects will start to break through.

You're about to start your breakthrough.



There is no need for a big blowout -

No need to demand, or even shout.

Press a finger to your own mouth.



Without becoming pessimistic,

Nor too detrimentally realistic,

Do the acts match the ambition?



The only game you can win at is yours,

Thankfully, you're who's keeping score.

If you want to, you can even play more.



Uproot suspicion, but seed vigilance.

Combine alertness with blissfulness,

As if there were truly no difference.



Can they take what you never offered?

Only if you let them be your author.

Edit them out, even if it's awkward.



Vigilance. Keep your eyes on the road.

Don't be distracted by your heavy load.

Beware conditions you cannot control.



Focus on precisely what you do best,

With a simple, "No," to all the rest.

Be so specific when you say, "Yes!"



To do the right thing at the right time,

Can be the trickiest thing to get right.

Execution tends to outperform insight.



Is this a thing you should be doing?

Is this the to be goal to be pursuing?

Is this a way to your own improving?



Though haphazard, even a bit reckless,

Or occasionally a little disconnected,

Your wildest is still very effective.



What level you reach never matters as much

As how deeply and often you're able to love

The people behind the work on your way up.



Be so careful using the word, "deserve."

There is a part of you this will unnerve,

The part that is happiest when it serves.



Be less concerned about what you're doing

As why you're doing it - who's approving.

May you be the reason you're producing.



You do things for others, of course, yes.

But putting this to the real inner test -

Isn't it meaningful to you, regardless?



There is a lot to be suspicious of

Regarding higher achievement:

Is love ever impressive enough?



Notice your general movement range.

How varied is it? How much the same?

Take your movements to another plane.



And what about your own deeper states?

Don't you ever wonder what else awaits?

Why not visit what creates and creates?



If it's uninteresting, why go farther?

So your disinterest can grow larger?

Why not schedule your departure?



More people to learn more from? Great!

Whether or not the way seems straight,

Where you can learn, you can create.



You are heading right into the unknown

For reasons that are not solely your own:

You'll reap even more than you've sown.



Work never turns into labor

As long as you're always able

To be dazzled by life's fable.



It's understandable you want to succeed.

Not to be mistaken for an actual need,

Understand this is a superficial belief.



You'll start picking up such momentum

That you'll have to revisit what's central

As you do today's work and then some.



Yes, love does call for a bit more patience,

With others and yourself, and displacement

Of what gets in the way of being gracious.



Do they know how much you care?

Based on your intention in the air?

Based on words you put out there?



What kind of relationship are you sowing -

One like weeds that needs constant mowing,

Or one like vines that rise high by holding?



Your sarcasm can engender endearment

(Except for those who genuinely fear it).

Be discerning of who likes to be near it.



Same as a vehicle stuck in the mud,

Relationships get caught into ruts:

Step out, pick a wheel, and lift up.



Nothing is irreparable unless you give up.

While sometimes it's time to say "enough,"

Sometimes it's a louder invitation to love.



It seems like you're being asked too much,

Being asked to change your ways and such.

But is your own measuring of it a crutch?



In the end, you'll decide what to become -

A person who does it that way or someone

Who does it their own way, and with love.



Over your unique brand of wit,

You may come across a critic.

What to do? Well, you pick.



There is no advice that can show the way,

Only words that give you a pleasant delay:

You know what to, and not to downplay.



Who do you see yourself as at your best?

How are you breathing - belly or chest?

What drives you - intention or interest?



Who do you envision you'll become

One moment after all this is done?

Fortunately, you are that someone.



Realize you are exactly who you will be

Unless you greet unknowns continually

And dare them to be more challenging.



Escape meetings that squander time

As a platform for those who whine.

Remember, delays are never benign.



Keep gentle track, don't keep hard score

(Your own time management is what for).

The last thing you need is another chore.



Set your first priority and treat this second

As something with which you will reckon

Just as soon as some free time beckons.



As soon as you're done feeling awkward,

Things can really begin to move forward

As you move deep in beyond this border.



Which parts of how you hope to feel

Are already part of your overall zeal?

(Sorry to spoil your future's reveal.)



Helping others becomes a sham or a lark

Unless you brave your own inner dark

And relax about your own life's arc.



It's your little quirks and sweet gestures

Rather than words composing a lecture.

You give this thing a very real texture.



Release the intention to impress.

It always has the opposite effect.

Just enjoy being yourself instead.



Simplest doesn't mean easy.

Rested doesn't mean sleepy.

Silent doesn't mean sneaky.



The trouble with focusing on a defense

Is that you lock into a state of suspense

Instead of opening up what comes next.



Find someone whose life is your mirror,

Where your own cycle is so much clearer,

And a way out may be that much nearer.



Remember that everyone has a story, too

That they are interested in telling you.

Remember to ask for details, not proof.



Ask for more than you've tried before.

Ask like it's a joy rather than a chore.

Ask in a way that builds real rapport.



Small dreams get fulfilled too,

But not by asking much of you.

Dream dreams you'll live into.



Everyone masters a different frequency.

If you dislike one, move on peacefully.

But the ones you love, enjoy dreamily.



Each in your wide array of friends,

Is a different, inward-turning lens.

What each reveals of you depends.



To think you have to hurry because of them

Is to assume one beginning leads to one end.

Branch off in any direction from that stem.



Those who dump on you one crisis

May think this gives them a license

To bring more. Here, no is wisest.



You are the perfect embodiment of beauty,

This moment's finest creation, absolutely.

The deepest part of you knows this truly.



Your habitual search - why not just stop?

You're not here to pursue, hunt, or shop.

You end up with what you've already got.



Connection - what if that's the whole point?

What if opportunities aren't here to exploit?

What if what you're here to do is give voice?



Consider how you impact the whole:

Your presence helps mindsets grow.

Yours is a delicate and crucial role.



Be far more eager to be shown you're wrong

Than to have your opinion hailed as strong.

You can't grow where you already "belong."



That kind of talk may feel so entertaining.

But it gives your mind improper training

For sincere thoughts that need explaining.



Today can feel like a brand new start,

But how can it be without the heart?

Feel before you take on this new part.



When you give yourself the chance to express

Just to yourself what you desire to do next,

You also discover needs you need to address.



Nothing drains a day like meaninglessness.

You can endure thankless work and stress,

But you must have your heartfelt progress.



This cannot be done in one day,

But don't let an hour slip away.

Perfect your process and replay.



When this is done, you'll be on to your next

Journey, peak, challenge, struggle, or test.

Be sure to bring the lessons of this quest.



In a grand scheme of things with lifelong use,

That goal is irrelevant, to the point of moot -

Unless it draws out what's meaningful to you.



It's time to let this carry you along,

Taking you to a new horizon's dawn.

Calmly aligned is where you belong.



You can do so much without a method,

And so little without being connected.

Without trying, affect and be affected.



Stop in the middle of what you're doing

And carefully inspect without ruining

Inner paths you're actually improving.



Don't do that. Choose neither instead.

Just for a moment - just in your head.

Now let your wildest curiosity spread.



What if you were far more questioning

Of the clamor that's become deafening?

Which ideas are officially trespassing?



Give that up and put this down.

What you need to do is ground

Yourself and then, rebound.



With a little bit of healthy stress,

You'll come out doing your best.

Now give this little trick a test.



There is only so far to push yourself

Before borrowing tomorrow's health,

Which deducts from tomorrow's wealth.



This is so very far from the end.

The sun will rise on this again.

Soon, if you must know when.



You haven't been able to get it to budge,

But it's now to where one little nudge

Will end up being more than enough.



The key is to shift yourself into a state

Where everything you attempt feels great

As you learn and pivot from each mistake.



Little changes will make a big difference.

Start with your surrounding environment

Then on to what has subtler significance.



Focus not where you feel greatest need

But on the source that helps you heal

Then let it know with what to deal. 



About those distractions...

For minutes of satisfaction,

They cost hours of traction.



Interruptions are your greatest adversary.

You would do well to consider them scary,

For all the bleak consequences they carry.



Let nothing interrupt you in this phase

Where sustained focus is the single way

You're going to get through this maze.



This is the time to shut interruptions down.

Are they from one side or from all around?

It is time to tally up their exact amount.



Something is once again trying to interrupt.

Though you feel like you know who or what,

Nothing but objective truth is good enough.



Nothing can obstruct,

No one can interrupt,

Momentum built up.



If you knew the cost of one interruption,

You'd accuse them of attempted corruption.

Let no one make your time their assumption.



Enough of allowing more interruptions,

Follow your dream's clear instructions:

"Fulfill me without further discussion."



What starts as a polite interruption

Becomes several rude repercussions.

Refuse without further discussion.



You've wished you'd waited longer

To let an awareness grow stronger,

So this time, sit here and ponder.



It could be worse, especially if you rush.

So tell your intensity to relax and hush:

Patience can turn an iceberg into slush.



Self-trust is both a weapon and a tool: 

Your mind believes what you tell it to,

More powerfully the more love you use.



You'll do best to find your tribe,

People who exude a similar vibe,

Making you feel even more alive.



In case you're wondering if you should,

Or that you'll risk being misunderstood,

Last minute changes can be very good.



Hold back. Don't exert your full force

Until the commotion runs its course.

Until then, stay close to your source.



Where can they go without you?

They will be needing help soon.

Give it, as graciously as you do.



Your strength defies all those threats

That may not have gotten news yet,

But that will dissolve nevertheless.



Raise the standard of conversation

So when anyone wishes to engage,

They rise to meet you or go away.



Challenge any ideas that go unquestioned.

Challenge expectations everyone mentions.

Challenge yourself to leave an impression.



Go where you've heard from reliable people

That you will be welcomed in as an equal

And leave feeling even more peaceful.



And now, what about your neighbor?

Are you a reason that they feel safer?

Can you do something even greater?



Does this part also need to be pleasant,

Or can you accept it as a painful segment

In the scope of a much larger lesson?



Do you know what you're capable of -

From chaos up to, and including, love?

Do you know the power of your touch?



If you talk it through very gradually,

You'll reconstruct things accurately.

Thought can work this immaculately.



If you believe you can do this passively,

This needs to be addressed and rapidly:

The only way to be involved is actively.



The words used may sound distressing,

But that's not the energy you're letting

In, so filter them with keen assessing.



There are too many here to solve them,

So peel back the layers of this problem.

Find one that's closest to the bottom.



Don't choose the answer that feels right.

Choose one you can hold up to the light

That won't make you doubt your sight.



How carefully did you think this through?

Have you tried on opposite points of view?

Have you found your assumptions are true?



To prevent energetic leakage,

Spot where darkness creeps in.

Seal cracks and shine, beacon.



"No" is a command. "Yes" is even more so.

One makes sure you stay. One prepares to go.

Use each in all its force, never an "although."



Their obnoxiousness might raise your pulse,

But you're freed from answering to insults.

A badly-written test can't get good results.



You only have to listen once.

If they lie, then you're done.

So, how many replays? None.



Whether or not you're now hurting,

Open up to at least one other person

To share where you feel uncertain.



If they don't deliver, don't begrudge.

But no second chances - don't budge.

Let your wasted time be their judge.



Memories trap one past in your mind, but

Change comes to what you leave behind.

There is nothing your thoughts confine.



This is nothing that you can do off-handed,

And something that goes far beyond manners:

You have to make a choice about standards.



You hold yourself to a fine set of standards,

But has anyone else questioned or answered

You with the same self-exploring candor?



You are allowed to say that was enough,

But not to say the road was too rough.

Recall those who consider you tough.



Your interest doesn't have to be entire.

You don't have to bow down to admire.

You can collaborate and not conspire.



If you hadn't used that version of yourself,

Their version might've stayed on its shelf.

Now you have to be transcendence itself.



What was it you were intending to protect

That in the end showed what you project?

Regroup. You have a lot of learning left.



"Standing your ground" will wear you out.

As fighting in the wrong war would feel foul,

Really, truly ask what you're fighting about.



Soon as a trickster notices you clutch,

They will toy with you over that stuff.

What do you cling to and, how much?



When you encounter some kindred souls,

You might hear yourself sounding bold.

It's because the depth of you just knows.



You're going where no one else has either.

So if you get a visit from anxiety's fevers,

Brave the shivers to journey even deeper.



Going where you normally won't,

Visitors visit who normally don't.

So venture out from your home.



The new is more tiring than the familiar.

Who works harder, a cleaner or a builder?

So the rest you need shouldn't bewilder.



Allow yourself to say no next time.

It's not that it busied up your life -

It's that it doesn't match your why.



Reasons get so entangled they're misleading.

Belief gets so self-absorbed it seems greedy.

But truth says, "I don't know, it's a feeling."



Think up a plan -

As fast as you can.

What just began?



Say yes without knowing.

Be busy without showing.

Get there without going.



Say no without excuse.

Let go, not just loose.

Don't plan - produce.



Is this now a problem you understand?

Have you, ever since you first began?

Can you make it basic, not advanced?



What approach are you taking to this?

One that any others would agree fits?

What other ways could you design it?



You assume it's about the issue, 

But it's almost only about you.

What have you committed to?



Let whatever you assert

Be actually studied first

Or the stumble will hurt.



Despite what everyone already prefers,

Answer maybe, and await what occurs.

A bit more time is what this deserves.



Whether or not you're comfortable with it,

This is not the opportune time to commit.

Find out for yourself if they're equipped.



This is no time for a final answer.

You need a little truth enhancer

To contact the real commander.



One more detail could do it -

Give insight to get through it.

Why not go out and pursue it?



Do what you want, when you want tomorrow.

To whom will that give joy, to whom sorrow?

Who's a companion (...and who's just cargo)?



If you could use some timeless sage advice,

Conjure it from the elders who live inside,

All the versions of you in your own mind.



You know you need to get up from this place,

To venture out into newer, more open space.

Onward, to the untold adventures that await!



This incident is an invitation disguised.

To follow where it leads would be wise.

Onward, to where you will next arrive.



It's alright that you turned it down before.

This time around you have so much more

Awareness, resolve, and tenacity galore.



Do you recognize your current mentor?

Not necessarily the one you had sent for,

But one who can get you to sense more.



This is only the first crossing.

So before you consider pausing,

Listen for your purpose calling.



Think of them as enemies or allies,

But what are they really in disguise?

Guides on the path of being alive.



Congratulations on surviving the start.

But you have reached the innermost part

Where the one way out is through heart.



What will you do with this reward?

What it was originally meant for?

What you now wish to explore?



This is all part of the larger adventure,

And why it was wise to do this together.

Their benefit is already beyond measure.



It's been rough, but you must rise again.

Get right back up and see this to the end.

If needed, by all means, rely on a friend.



You have won all the insight you've gained,

From days of struggle across weeks of strain.

You're different enough as to be renamed.



Even though you believe you are right,

You are "fighting" the wrong "fight."

So rise above this simplistic "side."



Admit that that has become unmanageable.

Now you can figure out what you'll handle,

And what, for now, will be understandable.



Some former strengths need to be restored,

Ones that asked least yet were most ignored.

Into these, your time must now be poured.



It may be most effective to surrender,

To invite whoever can to do this better

To take the lead on this one adventure.



Go deep within and take inventory -

Of what you value, where you worry,

And when you are fully in your glory.



This would be a time to be exact,

To explain where everything is at,

And say if you're feeling trapped.



Remove what you need out of this frame,

So your results don't just stay the same.

Be clear, or as they say, "make it plain."



Are you connected to this whole thing?

Is there a deep meaning that it brings

Whenever it's about to be occurring?



You're given enough time to be lazy,

And enough time to work like crazy.

The excuses - what would they be?



May your vision come with patience as well

So you have more than a short story to tell

About the highs and woes that once befell.



Many things come in, then go out of style.

Since many things only last a brief while,

Why not make yourself more versatile?



It's going to come out regardless,

So rather than hide in darkness,

Open up all your compartments.



Whether or not your work is done,

The time for transition has come.

No plan in place yet? Make one.



"I'm already here," isn't a reason to stay.

"I hate it here," isn't a reason to go away.

"I'm ready," is the best thing you can say.



Be so careful about your patterns.

While it's necessary to have them,

They end up being what you battle.



You can draft this whole upcoming chapter,

But do you aim to know what comes after?

Why not fill this plot with more laughter?



Change will get most of its way,

And perhaps give you a little say.

So what game will you ask to play?



Figure out who you are.

Even if it feels bizarre,

Dive farther than far.



To keep that mind sharp and fresh,

Focus it on tomorrow, what's next,

And all the wise ideas you can get.



It's going to get easier to say no

To today's plans after tomorrow.

Resist this resistance to growth.



Packing up, don't bring everything along.

In your luggage, only what's light belongs.

Carrying isn't the best use of being strong.



Without fixating too much on what's ahead,

Nor forgetting what your elders have said,

Invite your future self's wings to spread.



Deny no one the right to their own fears.

Tell no one to cut short their own tears.

As for you, transcend your own years.



Is there time to finish this? Definitely.

Especially if you approach it intensively,

Filling each minute with double density.



It's going to happen all of a sudden,

But don't let that burst your bubble:

You needed every bit of discussion.



Knowing you need a break

Is all wonderful and great.

What plans did you make?



The best way to know what's in you

Is through the challenges that prove

What real training you've been up to.



It's wonderful to cherish connection,

But not for mere sake of recollection.

Change is its own form of protection.



Who can really say if that is the right path?

Does it even add up when you do the math?

What you can know is if you feel attached.



Not knowing is most distressing

When you're intent on guessing.

Enough of this energetic betting!



Give yourself a pat on the back,

Because when doubt did attack,

You kept everything on track.



Truly, there is more to handle here,

But until the rest of the way is clear

Consider patience your latest career.



How long can you linger in limbo?

Right up until heart and mind both

Cooperate to climb out the window.



Leave yourself plenty of time

To declutter home and mind

For some interior redesign.



The counsel you keep will decide which

Direction to take and how you'll equip,

As well as what you'll stop awhile to fix.



People you feel drawn to, ask more questions.

There is something they are there to mention,

Your own, living and breathing, suggestion.



The whole thing is about to come together,

Across so many different parts made better

Because you bravely outlasted the weather.



Success will require you become ruthless,

Hunting down activities that are foolish,

And spotting imperfections like a jeweler.



Leadership is nothing to take lightly,

But your stepping up into it is timely.

To be most effective, shine brightly.



This is your leadership advice for today:

It is not what you say, but how you say it

That will convince others to try your way.



After awhile, you may become complacent,

When there arise fewer problems to chase.

Whatever time of day this occurs, awaken.



It is not what you do, but how you do it

That makes them help see you through it.

So apply all the goodness you can to it.



Your mind wants things to be just so.

Remind it not to attempt to control.

Remind it to be still, so it can grow.



Your ingredients are all right here.

You combine them by being clear.

Now create by holding truth dear.



Trust actions. Ignore words.

Lose concern. Outlast hurt.

Forgive second. Love first.



Listen - the answers are all right here,

And they don't even have to be sincere:

The right questions make it all clear.



You cannot just give - you have to receive,

Lest you unravel the same cloth you weave.

So answer this: what do you want or need?



Timing's not everything - it's but a fraction.

What is your real reason for taking action?

Where do you already feel the satisfaction?



Yes, some seek to gain by manipulating you.

So be aware of things you normally react to.

Dismantle your triggers. Discard all proof.



Be mindful of how you think of the work.

Does something else come to mind first?

Reframe things so your creativity bursts.



Can't you sense what awaits -

Ever-changing yet the same?

Greet your own deeper state.



After awhile you become it, so be careful.

Check for open spaces, and if they're full,

Clear them all out: heave, push, and pull.



Being that busy takes naivete.

Why not try this another way:

Do far more of far less today.



Forget thinking you need to be any wiser.

What creates major victories isn't minor:

Go farther faster with a focus that's finer.



Change your role, or it will change you.

Focus - not on something entirely new -

Focus on what you could be, not just do.



What did they say they would do?

And is that task now left to you?

Surely, isn't this enough proof?



Though far from inaccurate or wrong,

They've held you helpless far too long.

New ideas will help you farther along.



Start. Above all, be able to begin.

Being able to get back up is akin

To reversing any lose into a win.



Before telling yourself, "Of course!"

First then last, consider the source -

Are their results ones you aim for?



Focus, or wander. Decide, or drift.

Would you prefer to travel or sit?

This is where to make your shift.



You assume you know the outcome

By knowing what others have done:

No, more unfolds once you've begun.



Real or imagined, present or past,

It is good conversations that last.

Do you answer as well as you ask?



Listen straight through what's said.

Even if deception was their intent,

What will be clear is what's meant.



Bad habits will expose you in bad weather.

Good habits clothe you, better and better.

When doing each, be honest - not clever.



You cannot be clear enough for everyone,

So work to understand what you've done,

And leave the rest to their own outcome.



Take care of yourself.

Give care to yourself.

For now, nothing else.



Cut back - slowly but surely

On time wasted immaturely

To think a bit more purely.



If these questions are too odd, do forgive:

Do you want more You than you can give?

Is there a version of you You can outlive?



Your own personal miracles will come,

But not before getting one thing done:

Commit yourself to what you've begun.



When comfortable, you'll eventually lose.

When committed, you'll always improve.

When capable, you'll help others choose.



Own your process. Own your path.

Know all involved from first to last.

Offer trust (but check their math).



Yes, you've been giving all along!

Giving is what keeps you strong.

Give and give until it's all gone.



Committing for just a while

Is an unjust use of the mind:

Commit to this life redefined.



Be grateful for those who grate at you,

Get under your skin, peel your truth,

And make you make your Self anew.



Like attracting like is how life operates, so

Find your reflection in whoever frustrates:

Change yourself before changing associates.



Since you know what makes you happiest,

You know which things are meaningless.

Doing what feels better will now be best.



You are more than the places you've been,

More than the things you've done or seen.

So decide what you want today to mean.



For some, today's fate is coincidental.

For you, once you quiet the mental,

Everything invites you to be gentle.



As you raise up and send out cheers,

Leave room for any unexpected tears,

And for clues that you're right here.



You have spent enough time already.

One bit more would be unnecessary.

Bring only what you need to carry.



Be aware of what you choose to learn from.

Be certain the overall outcomes all add up.

Be sure you are being clearheaded enough.



What are you prepared to meet the day with?

With less than is needed, or more than fits?

Tomorrow is coming the same way today did.



One entertains, one enlightens, one annoys.

You use them - both as weapons and as toys.

Mind the energy a word serves or employs.



Before you consider things further,

Calm the inner intensity and fervor

One clear choice is a life preserver.



When choosing, be anything but nonchalant.

One choice is to grow - the other, to flaunt:

Invite what you need, forgo what you want.



A confident, comfortable tone of voice

Comes with knowing you have a choice,

Which comes easiest when you rejoice.



Wherever you have the greatest concern,

Is where to focus enough energy to burn

Away all but the greatest desire to learn.



Of all the things you are working on,

Which ones make a minute too long?

Which ones leave you feeling strong?



There will only be so much you can do,

So start figuring out what to cut loose.

Today, in some small new way, choose.



Sometime between this moment and then,

You will go on a journey of 1,000 breaths.

How well can you meet what comes next?



Even if they do it all just like you,

There's an energy missing - a truth:

It needs your imprint to be of use.



Keep watching your thought process;

Does it loop, or seek its new &ldquo;next&rdquo;?

Does it bloom from feeling blessed?



Whether it is what you have or find,

Wanting to give is a very good sign:

It means you and wealth truly align.



You could use a good emotional flush

To clear out leftovers from life's rush.

Let your heart's hidden waterfall gush.



You have to do this, and no one else.

Beyond needing to remind yourself,

You must define how to do it well.



No matter your acceptance of this as real,

You relive whatever way you prefer to feel.

Which emotions have the greatest appeal?



When you take yourself too seriously

You end up reacting, often irritably

When you could laugh, deliriously.



When mining gems, you must first go deep.

When harvesting crops, take a broad sweep.

When investing in yourself, don't be cheap.



For grand plans and big ideas be polite host.

Keep your best thinking relevant and close.

Thoughts of today are the ones to have most.



Success has its ceiling - failure has its floor.

To stay here, build walls - to go, make doors.

Everything has its journey - you have yours.



Lost in the land of opinions? Escape!

Before anything useful can take shape,

You must create, not endlessly debate.



Stop right here, in your own sublime,

A stop along your breathtaking climb:

That you're blessed, cannot be denied.



This breath out, in, then hold.

This is all you ever truly own.

This aware, now try saying no.



Your limitations are a wonderful thing

Because they welcome others to bring

Buckets to draw from your wellspring.



You are playing this role. Remember.

You are not stuck doing this forever.

When ready, go back to your center.



This is not how it is destined to be -

This is simply tomorrow's initially.

The key? Advance unapologetically.



Everything here says something about you -

About what you'll accept, what you refuse,

And most of all, about what you aspire to.



Sometimes your words must do battle.

But an argument is far from a hassle -

It is shows you what you can grapple.



Give when it feels right, don't if it doesn't.

Try not to imagine a situation that wasn't.

Give yourself the gift of good judgment.



Living too deep in your assumptions

Leaves too little room for discussion.

Create space by listening to someone.



Even though the idea might feel like a test,

No one can give you what you don't possess.

Isn't the thought itself one form of access?



You say it's important, yet speak of it when?

Daily? Weekly? Hourly? Just now and then?

Observe yourself and start asking this again.



Whether chasing yours or fleeing theirs,

Opinions waste this potential-packed air.

Actual information? Yes! Remain there.



Is what led to this specifically clear?

Are you on your path or generally near?

Are you again almost there or already here?



Know your limits - or at least recognize

When your core needs become sidelined.

Stop, until you're invited to harmonize.



You cannot imagine where this is going,

Not even in your very deepest knowings:

You cannot easily see your own glowing.



Choose which place you wish to inhabit,

If there's a map to get there, then grab it.

As for the compass - you already have it.



No matter what anyone's said or meant,

Be self-contained enough to be content;

You can be at peace, no matter the event.



You're about to learn a great deal more

Much faster than you ever have before.

You are about to be your own mentor.



Forgive who doesn't and bless who does.

Expect no help - but thank what comes.

Build from below to aim to rise above.



Don't take that on - it's not yours,

Nor is it anything you're here for;

Do what matters to you far more.



Is the unknown toxic or transformative?

Your answer will tell you where you live.

You tend to receive what you freely give.



You'll never know how close you came

To things going a much different way.

Still, play this out as lightly as a game.



Does being not nearly as bad make it good?

Does being a could make it a clear should?

Is time's test something it has withstood?



Calling it a struggle, guarantees strife.

With what you seek, today will be rife.

Ask better questions, live a better life.



If this is where you will sacrifice,

Everything will make itself right:

You'll turn even darkness to light.



Do not figure this out on your own.

Share with one other, and one alone.

Let them tell you what they behold.



Have you gotten so immersed you're buried?

Is this pattern permanent or just temporary?

Is any of this actually even at all necessary?



Keep going - that's mere temporary defeat.

Keep going - don't worry what's complete.

Keep going - a plan's forming underneath.



Your body knows what you need - but waits

For you to ask and listen, as long as it takes.

Once you hear, obey - and don't dare debate.



When a relationship has run its course,

Make room for grief - but not remorse.

It's brought you closer to your source.



Most of the journey is about noticing -

Not about moving, but about focusing -

It is about counting, but not totaling.



This is where the bridge is to be built.

Rushing will cloud the water with silt,

So work at a sure pace, not at full tilt.



It is fine to change your mind,

Unless you do so all the time,

In which case, follow a sign.



The choice was made for you, but own it.

Own the lessons. If you'd only known it,

You might not have tried to postpone it.



Wish them into a circle of love and light,

After making sure your own circle is tight.

You can't give what you don't have, right?



You need a few true comrades - not a fort.

You don't need advice - you need support.

You're not staying - you're set to explore.



Do yesterday's promises mislead or assure?

Do you intend or expect today's to endure?

Hold them to their word, and you to yours.



Realizing your own intuition has a lens

Raises your own vibration's wavelength,

Granting internal, impregnable strength.



Whether doing it with sorrow or spunk,

That's enough of sifting through junk -

When do useless thoughts get unthunk?



Be brave. Venture forth. Dive deep.

Calmly endure. Courageously weep.

Love (what you share, you keep).



The effort used to call things bad or good

Is far better used getting this understood:

What's behind, ahead, already underfoot?



Like it or not, you're the commander -

Responsible for questions and answers:

You need to keep raising your standard.



You can't unsee a night of endless stars.

After one long journey, none are too far.

You can't become who you already are.



You won't let yourself hide your own mess.

You won't put yourself to some undue test.

You will lovingly, patiently, fully address.



To reach out to anyone - near or far,

Just reach here into your own heart.

To master this ability, simply start.



You cannot hold on - this is all a flow.

You cannot stay anywhere - it all goes.

You can ride this stream, as you know.



What about you? Where do you factor in?

Where do your own best interests begin?

When will you let yourself be certain?



Even though you feel what love shows,

Do you think you know how love goes?

You can't, this is where you let life flow.



Beware of stories that are too segmented.

Trust words that arrive simply presented;

Hear straight through (to be contented).



There is no better way. Go straight through.

Take the path that is the least like that you.

There is no better way. Go straight through.



This is you, embrace it or wait.

Appreciate it all - early or late.

This is you - a miracle of fate.



Ask your questions about moving forward,

But not so many that the now gets ignored.

Ask so you feel what you're moving toward.



Give them answers that keep you in focus

Because you're all you can see up closest.

So let clarity be your underlying motive.



Heart before head,

Find your own yes

In this one breath.



Circumstances cannot change what is true,

Nor can they pick which feelings to choose,

So most of those offerings can be refused.



There is one rule you never want to fight:

That single rule is that like attracts like -

So be quicker to be a guest than to invite.



You may receive praise for being blunt,

But straightforwardness is not enough -

Now start doing it from a place of love.



Spend time where it's an investment.

When taken for granted, give it less.

Wherever it grows you, be its guest.



Though tough, keep your composure

When you feel left open to exposure:

Fierce inner honesty creates closure.



A subtle difference in your approach

Turns the journey back into your own,

Because you will need to feel to know.



Though the mind calls it an eternity,

Wait for things to happen effortlessly;

To grow with grace, first know ease.



Everything has a vibration - a wavelength -

That can amplify your own life's strength.

Knowing what you know, which is best?



Do you even realize how loved you are?

How the thought of you warms hearts?

How a feeling you inspire heals harm?



You are blessed to have someone you trust,

To have someone for whom you are a must,

Who is a steady wind and not just one gust.



There are others along this path to seek,

Who, though mighty, may appear meek.

Go and ask them about their latest peak.



The difference between learning and judging?

While one is changing, one won't be budging.

Stay open (You can always gain something).



Will they get to hear what you're up to?

Will you be straightforward or smooth?

What does it mean to live Your Truth?



You play one role they all know and love,

But for you - is that role nearly enough?

Can you pretend to be what you're above?



What's key is to maintain a circle of trust

That holds within it the people who just

Meet your needs without making a fuss. 



Of course, not everyone needs to know,

Since not everyone wants you to grow.

Be conscious of what you tell or show.



Unrecognizable in the very best of ways

Is what you are on this very best of days:

So you deserve the very best of hoorays.



Spend a moment honoring the past -

Acknowledging where you were last;

You've done more than conquer tasks.



Spend more time, gain more skill.

You'll get better - you truly will.

Make your day focused, not filled.



You're being forged by your own life's flame.

You're being molded, so try not to complain.

You're being transformed, and love remains.



When did you last feel unbounded?

In love and light fully surrounded?

By all around you, truly astounded?



Worry if you prefer, but life flows despite.

Call it all wrong - it's all still quite right.

Once you only love, there will be no fight.



Staying in a cycle of crisis and rescue

Is alright for others, but not for you:

Keep working on undeniable truths.



Donating is one thing, spending another.

In regards to your time, give it no further

Unless you feel there is nothing worthier.



Inviting one thing does not invite another.

If you are imposed upon, say yes no further.

Time to invite what you know will nurture.



Give some whole days, give others seconds.

To all but a few, let your availability lessen.

Limit distractions and welcome blessings.



There is one place to share your fears,

One place to shed your deepest tears -

Wherever it is you are held most dear.



Love doesn't cling to yesterday's story -

Nor does it find the details mandatory;

To love, the past is a fable or allegory.



Things you believed, that made you certain

Kept you in the dark, but kept you working:

Take down those beliefs' heavy, old curtain.



To trust that it will, it should already be.

Let past precedent step forward to speak.

Do so long before turning your I into we.



If you're so fortunate as to have a vision,

You're responsible to make the decision

To create all your own ideal conditions.



It's not that you're never satisfied -

It's that you know what's still inside

And will not stop until it's arrived.



It's not out there - it's right here inside.

And "trying" is also a clever way to hide.

Stop using effort. Open your heart wide.



Of course, going back will be tempting, 

But it's grace itself you're preempting.

Forward is the direction of a blessing.



The doing part gets easier as you go.

The hardest part is inviting growth,

The kind that has nothing to show.



Be humble, treating all as your mentor.

Be fierce when safeguarding your center.

Be open, letting nothing but love enter.



That is a want that is not a need.

Feeling safe is never guaranteed.

So what should you do? Proceed.



Accept that you're not here to protect

Because you have no idea what's next.

What you can do is lovingly connect.



Forgiveness can feel like the weakest,

Just loving when things are bleakest;

Forgiveness holds a few more secrets.



Let it go if you want to move on,

On into your greatest life's dawn,

On to where you already belong.



Once you align with what makes you strong,

You'll get better at moving decisions along,

And faster at removing what doesn't belong.



Having what you don't want is easy enough.

The real challenge? Focus on what you love

So much that nothing else could measure up.



There's no big declaration you must make,

But there is one daily step you must take:

Ask and be sure you are completely awake.



Your mindset sets the general pace,

Makes this into a journey or a race -

Something you endure or celebrate.



Can they make you believe what you don't?

No one makes you feel some way you won't.

As you do this day, what is your approach?



Share it with people who wish you well.

To anyone else, there's nothing to tell.

Talk to those who'll do more than yell.



"Yes" to meeting everyone you possibly can,

"Maybe" to a next meeting, depending, and,

"No" to anyone who trifles with your plan.



Your vision gets to be even bigger still,

Not for the sake of achievement's thrill,

But to reach whoever else it can fulfill.



Do something for someone you don't know.

Notice, somehow your appreciation grows,

Brimming up past the point of overflow.



You may feel scared, but you are not afraid,

Proven by the fact that you never hesitate

To face what comes, or gets in, your way.



Life is going to twist and turn all by itself;

You just stay hyperfocused on good health -

Eat, sleep, think, learn, speak, and be, well.



When dependability is what's required,

There's no time for you to feel mired:

Call upon friends who don't get tired.



To do this, you'll need some new peers,

Ones who have conquered similar fears,

Ones whose wisdom will save you years.



When choosing between two unknowns,

Pick the one whose stories are untold -

The one calling to you, and you alone.



No one needs what you want them to have.

No, that is not what can ever make them glad.

Yes, what they crave is the kindness you add.



You will have to pay a price to get it done,

Or go on a well-intended, but circular run.

It's time to ask for help and hire someone.



You have so much depth - unfathomable.

You have so many options - unimaginable.

You have so much to offer - unmatchable.



Everyone is helping - allies and otherwise.

Even the harshest critic is a friend in disguise.

Without variety, you wouldn't feel this alive.



You hear the difference in your own voice,

Hear it when you don't just speak to avoid,

Hear it when you declare your next choice.



Own up to it, and then move this along.

Wallowing is not where anyone belongs.

Own where you are. Own being strong.



You're as amazing as the best of your friends,

As challenging as all those at the other ends:

You're where all your connections begin.



Say that you're about to say it,

Then as if you rehearsed, say it,

And recap so they can weigh it.



It may go that way for some, but not you.

For you, there is a different way through.

It has always been different, but not new.



To be sure you'll have something to show,

This time, you should do what you know -

Next time you can let the unknown unfold.



If what you think and how you then act

Are somehow sometimes so mismatched,

What you need to do then is to backtrack.



Think through the feeling you felt, but act.

And if your actions left your thoughts intact,

You have a place to which to come back.



Use your intuition, but only for yourself.

Tune in to, for, with, about no one else.

Know: to use it quietly is to use it well.



Knowing what this is for is the challenge.

Knowing how much to rest is the balance.

Knowing when you don't know is so valid.



That's enough of living overextended.

This isn't what anyone ever intended.

Do far less and feel far more splendid.



When you are given an excuse, be grateful.

They are telling you they have a plateful

In a way that is nothing short of fateful.



This is not even nearly the end, so relax.

This is nothing to worry about. Detach.

This is where to let complexity collapse.



The "truth" is, you may indeed feel tired.

But if there's something you truly desire,

Truth is something your will can rewire.



You've got to try one more combination,

One that doesn't obey formal education.

Options are born from experimentation.



If today ever feels either boring or hectic,

Explore spaces between seeker and skeptic:

Don't just tout your favorite belief - test it.



You get help, but not before you need it.

Certain things must first get completed

So that your time gets properly treated.



To even keep that around is too much.

If it's within reach, in range of touch,

Then it is you who are in its clutch.



Between here and becoming genuinely old,

Whether you have to be shown or just told,

Are daily reminders to lighten your load.



How healthy are your words of doubt?

Are they a worthwhile use of a mouth?

Do they make things shrink or sprout?



And if you could say anything right now,

With more than words from your mouth,

What would you / should you - and how?



They are offering what they have to give.

Expecting more is a stressful way to live.

So be welcoming rather than combative.



Keep gradually raising your standards,

In daily ways that are easier to handle.

What one habit could you dismantle?



Exactly what you think about, so beware.

As for default thoughts - don't you dare.

Which thoughts are best? You compare.



Your path to peace is always the same -

It starts wherever you begin each day:

Give each day its own beautiful frame.



What you have to do is properly frame it,

Which starts with how you even name it.

When? Oh, on a first-thing, daily basis.



Not everyone will like what you say,

But it's key to move forward anyway.

To be silent is to lead yourself astray.



You no longer have any of the old excuses:

Be sure you get to be the one who chooses,

As well as the one who also calmly refuses.



Are you still giving the past your breath

Retelling what happened way back then?

Can you leave it where it asks to be left?



If things were different they'd be better?

If you believe so, should water be wetter?

Live to your heartbeat - not to the letter.



Before you even begin to begin to get upset,

Realize you changed your inner environment

And they haven't received the news just yet.



Expect no one and nothing to adjust to you

(Expect things to happen exactly as they do).

Expect the best way to be straight through.



Trying to skip straight to the ending

Is trying to get time to start bending

When the now is what needs mending.



Some friendships will make you wiser -

Others let you reach that much higher.

The best ones get the worst ones fired.



To be clear about this, you only need one -

Whether to start or to get anything done;

To reach what's next, you only need one.



Today, regardless of which path you choose,

Wherever you go, you'll be put to good use:

It's who you are - never what you produce.



Here's how to judge if that's just irrelevant:

Is going deeper something that can or can't

Result in something that would be evident?



What kind of frame have you put it in?

One that considers it a lose or a win?

Or considers this where you begin?



There is a fire burning within you

That burns away every dry untruth,

And grows using experience as fuel.



Beware of that endless desire for more -

Quests, treasures and celebrations galore.

This moment is something to be adored.



Change doesn't come by way of an event -

Via loud, exciting, electric environment -

But by an unspoken, daily commitment.



And once you give them what they want,

So that they're pleased enough to flaunt,

Leave them and return to your confidant.



Whatever the facts show,

You'll just have to know

That you're here to grow.



All you can ever give anyone is a feeling,

Not information or creative conceiving.

And you give what you're busy believing.



Your belief is not wrong - it's incomplete

Because it's missing who you'll soon meet

Whose thoughts will beautifully entreat.



Trust the gradual, doubt the drastic.

Enjoy the fun, sidestep the sarcastic.

Within the simple lies the fantastic.



Wherever you are told you must rush

Is where you are being told to hush:

Go where you can honestly discuss.



That is enough of your people-pleasing.

Dedicate all that time to deep breathing:

You do your greatest good by releasing.



Far from being self-absorbed,

Face your endless inner world

And feel yourself fully adored.



You get to feel incredibly more

Than you'd ever imagined before

Every time you do what you adore.



Every space you enter already has an energy -

Dim or bright, stale or open - never empty.

Where you feel something indescribable, be.



Protect yourself as you would anywhere -

Being fiercely positive yet calmly aware.

Your entire day deserves this much care.



If given something you don't wish to have,

Resist the urge to immediately give it back:

Explore its paradox - the abundance of lack.



A goal is just a milestone

Along one journey's road:

Travel to more unknowns.



If the unimaginable awaits in your dreams,

Nothing is ever as far off as it might seem:

So the cure for any limiting belief is sleep.



What you consider to be a problem

Might be to them, a generous offer.

Imagining this, let yourself soften.



Soon you will just feel it in your bones,

Without needing confirmation to know

That you are finally on your way home.



In your long list of things left to do,

Is there time for just being with you?

And when should that task come due?



You don't have to believe to be flowing,

Don't have to know where you're going,

But you do need to be done with owing.



Slow down if that's what you feel you need.

There is rarely a lasting benefit from speed.

Impact comes from your depth - not a deed.



When opportunity arrives unannounced,

Drop whatever you're doing and pounce.

In the moment, now is all that counts.



To give, you require a proper foundation,

In your own chosen, most ideal location -

Softly grounded for your heart's creation.



Do you understand the importance of joy?

With it, there's no thing for you to avoid.

Within it, there's clearly a clearer choice.



How you frame today is the whole thing:

It puts you on a journey - or in the ring.

Are you meant for survival or radiating?



It's too soon - stop thinking about it.

Find something useful to get on with,

Something that immediately uplifts.



Where you're going may be straight ahead,

But focus on how you get there instead -

Notice what's beneath, not just overhead.



Preparation is one part, yes.

But more important than this

Is to decide to feel your best.



Who makes your day feel prized?

With whom do you feel most alive?

Is this how you schedule your time?



But are you enjoying this as it is?

Or must it serve a future that fits?

Isn't it just marvelous you exist?



Yes, you could have been better prepared,

But of this you should likewise be aware:

Life left you a perfect lesson right there.



Make it so. Make it what you choose.

When you do, there is no win or lose,

There is only your well-lived truth.



Who you are now is far from who you were.

Though those who knew you might concur,

You're busy focusing tomorrow from a blur.



Oh yes, you most certainly can -

Not as you'd originally planned,

But from good to great to grand.



Are you giving them what you choose,

What you believe that they could use?

Or what they simply asked you to do?



Ask questions, then let the answers brew.

Revisit your thoughts and then ask anew.

Evermore enlightening answers await you.



Mentors are all around you, just waiting

For you to listen, and without debating:

You can learn by hearing or imitating.



Have the conversation. It needs to happen

(Even if everything hasn't been fastened).

Bring nothing but truth and compassion.



It is fine to make a few exceptions,

But not if they cause misdirections.

What are your clearest perceptions?



Be rushed by no one.

You cannot be outrun.

Only you define done.



The best thing to give is your being -

Your own lived, unique way of seeing.

Then just hearing you will be freeing.



You can only give what you are.

Nothing else can ever be on par.

A loving life is heard from afar.



What are you missing that you need today?

To be what you wish, what's in your way?

Or are you already ready, come what may?



Right here is where it is to be found -

Right on or beneath this very ground.

Right where your experience abounds.



Are you open to delving deeper still?

Far past where you can reach by will?

Good, get rid of your inner "until..."



This thing you claim to want to know,

Will this information help you grow?

If not, inform your busy brain, "No." 



Wellness comes by thinking about it.

But sickness does as well, undoubted.

So keep today's thoughts unclouded.



You get confirmation every day

That this is but a temporary stay,

What you need is on its own way.



What does your mind think is missing now?

To journey to peace does it even know how?

Try telling it no more thinking is allowed.



Are you sincerely looking for a sign?

It may be here based on how you align.

What if it were one that you designed?



Too-complete a schedule can squander time

Via too little for heart, too much for mind.

Save space to savor some surprise sublime.



Who do you need to hear from right now?

Who knows what to say, and exactly how?

Who but you awaits as the one you allow?



How do you talk to yourself? In what tone?

Do you chide, chastise, challenge, condone?

Be kind, self-talk will never leave you alone.



Forget what's coming. Be here for this.

The future doesn't even actually exist.

Now is the only time you can inhabit.



Make the decision for them. Make it easy.

It is not that they are desperately needy -

You can weigh the options more freely.



Prep for as long as you like - they will wait.

When you're ready, you won't be called late.

So use this time to rise from good to great.



You don't have to engage with any of that,

Even if you send it away and it comes back.

Just pile it onto your outbound junk stack.



Engaging with too much skepticism

Interferes with serendipity's rhythm.

Escape doubt's conversation prison.



You've stood behind and beside,

Why not try in front for awhile?

Everyone benefits from that smile.



The feeling is the whole point.

Everything else will disappoint.

Listen for it in your own voice.



Frame the day in the feelings you prefer

And this will almost magically transfer

To make things you think about occur.



If said with love, your words won't harm.

While your truth may not woo or charm,

It will at least embrace rather than alarm.



The feeling is the destination:

Feeling needs no concentration,

Just an openly inward orientation.



Which feelings would you allow?

Could you expand this, and how?

What are you feeling right now?



Your body? Your body does not mind.

It will wait until you give it the time.

Once you listen, it will calmly unwind.



The keepers, they meet you at your best.

They give you ease, rob you of all stress,

And cheer even if you feel you're a mess.



When you follow true feeling's flow,

Leaving behind all that you &ldquo;know,&rdquo;

Get ready for how well this will go.



Try to keep things simple and plain.

Then, if any problems return again,

Your principles steadfastly remain.



Though ease shouldn't be the overall goal,

You will find that once your truth is told,

All will go well. True love will be shown.



From where you are - from right here,

The way may not be particularly clear.

The best way to solve that? Be sincere.



Anything can be framed with love

If you are viewing it from above:

Imagine yourself far up enough.



Stop trying to fix what you call broken

And focus instead on favorite notions -

On the things that keep you wide-open. 



Would you say that you feel satisfied?

If so, or not, is it connected to pride,

Or from work you do on the inside?



Head toward what feels farthest from here.

Go where the way is too untrod to be clear.

Leave yourself no option but to be sincere.



So much awaits on the other side of risk.

So stop waiting for circumstances to fit:

So quickly can you get yourself to shift.



You don't have to respond right away.

Why not even save it for another day?

Right now, be busy being beyond ok.



Whenever you have to get back on track,

You become the rescuer, who must react.

Make better choices, make more impact.



Who you wish to please - do they even care?

Where you hope for - are you already there?

Of your living dream are you finally aware?



You concoct your own trickiest distractions,

The blockades that come disguised as action;

There's a very short path to your satisfaction.



Too many words crowd out the whole point.

Too much emotion can get you out of joint.

Not everything needs to be entirely voiced.



Nothing you do will last noticeably long

After you, or it, or both have moved on:

Today is where all of your focus belongs.



Regardless of what advisers or critics say,

Are you at ease with simply walking away?

You wield power even when you abstain.



It's not coddling - be kind to yourself.

It's the quickest way to restore health

By putting above this you, no one else.



Your response is coming from all of you -

Not just your mind - from your body too:

So listen to what has nothing to prove.



Remember coming back from the brink?

Reacting in faster than one blink?

Realizing you know more than you think?



What if you knew you were halfway there?

Does that feel more like a boost or a dare?

And what if now, you are twice as aware?



When did you last feel the magic of fate?

When goodness came from running late,

Or when intuition told you to hesitate?



Only you know if this is still engaging,

Whether it's time for some rearranging,

Where things could feel more amazing.



Only you know whether you've had enough,

Whether you now prefer smooth or rough,

Whether this is where you can best love.



For all the things you've yet to discover,

The present is not some future's buffer -

No, it's inviting you to be its true lover.



For every grain you believe you understand,

There's an endless beach more worth of sand;

Treasure the wisdom you've gotten firsthand.



Being absent, abrasive, or abrupt,

Takes a certain courage to give up;

Thoughtfulness is always enough.



First serendipity brought you a gift.

Then you tried to plan on top of it.

Now you know better (no limits).



How did you get to this place?

One part work, two parts grace,

And a touch of love's embrace.



All day long, you are being blessed

With experiences. None are a test.

Each is a sacred gift, and no less.



How do you think you got exactly here?

In retrospect, the way may seem clear,

But you can't be certain, so be sincere.



Make sure you're doing it for yourself

And not just because of someone else.

Be deadly serious about your health.



Treasure what you're moving toward

And you won't spend one day bored:

Being the pioneer is its own reward.



There is no perfect order in which to do,

However, there is a way that best fits you.

Rearrange things until they perfectly suit.



You can only truly appreciate enough

Moments after you've had too much.

Proceed in conscious awareness, love.



When you're sick, you want to get better.

When stuck, you yearn to be unfettered.

Wait this out. You'll soon be the getter.



Too much of a good thing is its opposite,

So try an approach that is more moderate.

Often, better than precise is approximate.



Don't go overthinking what comes next,

Because this time, fate may truly perplex;

There's no explanation that it will respect.



Happiness. Do you have your own definition

(And not just some dusty, old acquisition)?

Your happiness wants your full recognition.



Your happiness is something to feel up close,

Rather than as some diluted, occasional dose.

Is your happiest thing what you do the most?



Do you identify with the word happy?

Or does the link feel somewhat tacky?

(Many of the joyful are called wacky.)



Happiness isn't so much a goal

As it is to defy what you're told

In order to live from your soul.



Stop limiting yourself to a purpose,

As if without it you'd be worthless:

You're here now, so put living first.



What task were you about to choose?

Stop. Remember who you are. Undo.

There is nothing left for you to prove.



When might you consider that to be done?

Once you've tallied all the victories won?

Why not enjoy the peace of your inner sun?



Pay attention and you'll know when it's time

To duck out, double down, or slightly realign.

But pay attention using more than your mind.



Simplifying magnifies what you do best,

While casting its shadow across the rest.

Focusing reminds you to do more of less.



You can do one thing better than two.

Single-minded focus travels faster, too.

Truth and power is what it will lead to.



Be careful, what you take in will come out,

Through your demeanor if not your mouth.

What are your daily inputs generally about?



There is a point at which you must alter

Direction or approach so as not to falter.

But make adjustments that are smaller.



The future should never be your concern.

There's nothing there for you to discern.

Right now is where you need to return.



You can't be served by some other day,

So bring your mind back here to play,

And go catch it when it tries to stray.



Eventually, you'll get your fill of this.

You'll realize you've grown tired of it.

You'll find that fewer explanations fit.



Notice when you delay - don't force it.

Investigate, understand, and support it.

Find out what it needs. Move toward it.



Do you understand your relationship to it?

That that's a title? Do you see through it?

What you truly are - you cannot view it.



Is this feeling over something that happened?

Is it the cooking that causes a belly to fatten?

Your feelings bend reality to your reactions.



Most of what you read, you'll mostly forget -

But you'll always remember, once you've met

Someone who, though in crisis, wasn't upset.



Dream up a dream, then make it real,

That is, so long as it still has appeal.

If it does not, explore some new field.



Nothing you strive to produce

Will forever be put to good use.

You are more than what you do.



There is nothing to worry about, alright?

Even if you're comfortable being uptight,

Deep down, you're feeling something bright.



The things you do are what they are,

But, in relation to you, painfully far

From anything you could call on par.



Everyone loves being around you

More than whatever else you do:

Be accessible - no need to move.



Wondering what to do next

Turns this day on its head:

Enjoy more todays instead.



Rearrange things until they feel just right,

Until they harmonize with what is inside

Of you that runs far deeper than pride.



See this for what it is, then move on.

Make good use of it, and then be gone.

Feeling untethered makes you strong.



Being observant is not enough still,

Nor is wielding the power of will -

You need to balance ease and skill.



It's understandable - to grow bored.

You need something to move toward,

As well as away from all you've stored.



Though your life is filled with pleasures,

Your connections are your only treasures.

Hugs and hours are how they're measured.



Regardless of when you began,

Try as many things as you can

With or without any set plan.



How critical to you are their thoughts?

Try speaking even less than you ought.

Listening will tell you more than not.



Always need to jump into the fray?

If you can figure out another way,

Why not, so you can enjoy the day?



What did you do to enjoy yourself today -

Something that sent your mind far away?

Or that brought far-off bliss here to stay?



Share some silence with everyone you can -

Fit some into each conversation's timespan.

Whoever is quietest, speak even less than.



How much can you say not saying a thing?

This is useful if you weren't asked to bring

Your particular peacefulness into their ring.



Think of today as a seed in the ground -

Or as the start of two harmonious sounds:

Goodness grows, then greatness abounds.



Yes, it should be as easy as this.

Leave struggle right where it is.

When you resonate, things fit.



You're on your way

Or else in your way

(Mind all you say).



Who have you been appeasing?

What are you busy believing?

Answers are simple, not easy.



Before you get yourself too immersed,

Your list may need to be reversed.

What can be done once - do first.



Do those thoughts matter, really?

In order to perceive more clearly,

Try recollecting more sincerely.



Regardless, new acquaintance or old friend,

The point is that you share time with them.

Will your results be worth what you spend?



Feedback comes from a given direction.

To decide if it's worth your attention,

Recall exactly how it was mentioned.



Proceeding in your own best interest

Benefits everyone because it attests

To living honestly, at its simplest.



How do you wish to feel as you go through?

Is there someone you should be talking to?

In short, what is it you need to do for you?



Be unrushed, yet responsible with your time.

Both - your steps and your path - must align.

Keep clarity (rather than distance) in mind.



Noise is just that - don't get distracted.

To what were you originally attracted?

Well now, what needs to be subtracted?



The only thing with which to be dealing?

Appreciate what you find most appealing

In when, what, and how you are feeling.



You downplay how much time that wastes.

Get away from there with all due haste.

Free your time (defend what you liberate).



By focusing on nothing but your strengths,

Your efforts might not need to be as intense

(When relaxed, you travel greater lengths).



Enjoy every detail of your everyday space.

Change what you can. All else, lend grace.

Create your own daily beauty's birthplace.



Flawlessly imperfect, you are sublime.

Perfectly flawed, you are perfectly fine.

Thus, self-judgment deserves zero time.



Do flies draw dung, or does dung draw flies?

It's not that every single word must be wise -

What will your next conversation fertilize?



Focusing on the cold won't keep you warm.

What you speak of most takes greater form:

Strengthening your shelter weakens the storm.



Be responsible for how you spend your time.

Taking today as neither all gala nor all grind,

Let pleasure and progress somehow combine.



Don't waste time deducing why they did that.

Accept what happened as a matter of fact.

You need to regroup. You don't need to react.



Own as much of your day as possible

So that if you encounter an obstacle,

You can own what makes it solvable.



You do know it won't always be like this -

So stop assuming you know what will fit.

Notice, you yourself are starting to shift.



All the possessions that you now have

All become belongings you once had:

All you keep is the feeling you match.



Soon you'll have to put it all out there.

Not for them to see how much you care,

But so you become finally - fully aware.



It's time to just put it all out there.

Is part of you asking, "But where?"

In the exact place you hadn't dared.



The time for gradual progress is behind you.

What's here now is an almost magical route,

An actual way, not a shortcut breakthrough.



The giving of advice doesn't mean they know

Any more than telling means they can show.

On your own, you'll either succeed... or grow.



Others with far less are far more grateful.

So the next time you feel inwardly hateful,

Count your blessings - and by the plateful.



To conversation's momentum, don't just bow.

You didn't initiate, but you're part of it now.

Answer: "You would rather be feeling how?"



By saying less, you'll be becoming more

Since in your silence is where you store

The map to each and every forevermore.



Neither desire nor drive have as much

Power as resolve that arises from disgust:

This feeling turns a should into a must.



Do you remember how resolve can feel?

How it simultaneously helps and heals?

Resolve neither to attack - nor to yield.



It's always a process. You pick what kind.

Obey your heart, while using your mind.

Whatever you seek, you will surely find.



Is there something you're trying to rush?

Is there someone you're starting to hush?

Can you humbly hear, not loudly discuss?



The timing of everything is perfect,

And so of this you can be so certain:

The waiting will always be worth it.



It always takes time, it just always does,

To turn an "impossibility" into a "was,"

To get you to ignore all else - but love.



Away with you distraction will try to sweep,

So a tight focus on your well-being do keep,

Even to the point of noticing how you sleep.



When you're happy it emits from your pores -

From your own bottomless, limitless stores.

Even right now - you're making even more!



When you're in the right spot, things click:

Opportunities land all around you and stick.

So find today's rightest right spot - then sit.



Trust there is a naturally occurring hour

When your efforts will naturally flower.

Over exactly when, you have no power.



Conceiving of an idea may feel like the best

Part, but birthing it is what must come next,

So, it may be wisest to not celebrate just yet.



There's only so much you can take with you

Or use along your journey, trek, or pursuit.

For your own sake, just cut most of it loose.



There may be standard wisdom you can use,

But it's better if you yourself freshly choose.

Each situation has all of its necessary clues.



Make room - you have to make room

For what will be on its way very soon.

Beforehand, give it the space to bloom.



Treasure your joys more than you do.

Appreciation is more than you assume:

What makes you wealthier is gratitude.



All you can do is all you can do,

But only you know what's true -

If you're breaking out or through.



The best path is the one that rises highest.

The best load is the one that feels lightest.

The best way is the one full of brightness.



This may not be the right time for that,

And yet it is still a perfect time to act -

What you must do first is fully detach.



Why you do what you do may be unclear,

But is how you feel about it so sincere

That you'd do it regardless who's here?



No, your awareness was simply smaller.

Yes, it is going to take a little bit longer.

The wait makes you that much stronger.



Would you rather rush and understand less?

Because this is neither a race nor is it a test,

It's going to go on until you live what's best.



Focus on what fulfills, and nothing else.

Trust that the rest will take care of itself.

Your joy is the true source of your health.



You can always find something to fix.

Can you fixate instead on what uplifts?

You will know by how it exactly fits.



Goodness doesn't take work, it takes time,

Time to find balance of heart over mind,

Time to lovingly greet all that you find.



Would you rather a story or the plain truth?

Are the twists and turns a worthy substitute

For living the untold beauty of being You?



Time is a foundation on which you're forming

A building meant for far more than storing, so

Beware, of what your time may be absorbing.



Strife is a sign you're in the wrong place.

But rather than plan your dramatic escape,

Focus only and always on noticing grace.



Spreading goodness in your actual vicinity

Outweighs helping those who are imaginary;

Create with a genuine sense of community.



Are you listening? In a way that hears this?

In a way that's not fidgeting to find or fix?

Are you listening for what naturally fits?



Is there something someone needs to give you

In order to start or finish what you must do?

Of course not - of this you are living proof.



Believing there's something you must give

Is as imbalanced as remaining combative -

All you can offer is showing how to live.



It may feel good to focus and refine -

And better still to then be recognized -

But all you ever need to do is... shine.



No more plans - for this, use your heart.

Your mind can play completely no part.

From your gut is where this must start.



Only by making space can you receive.

Only by trusting will you ever believe.

Only by letting go will you conceive.



Ah, of course you have a plan for the day.

But things are headed their very own way.

To keep up, attention is the price to pay.



When you feel the least control over events

Is when you transcend your environment

And experience the day's enlightenment.



Rushing gets you so turned around.

Rushing is a longer way, slow down.

Rushing chases, presence surrounds.



Today will be over by tonight, guaranteed.

With it, everything but what you felt, leaves.

So invest in tomorrow with all you receive.



Less about their needs - more about yours.

By tending to yourself, you build new doors,

Opening both you and them to new cures.



Think less - feel more,

Because what's in store

Grows by being adored.



Keeping busy will win you no prize,

And may even be laziness in disguise;

Doing far less is the work of the wise.



The answers arrive when you are still.

So even when busy, set aside your will

And feel the space you've created fill.



Trying to think your way out of overthinking

Is like a ship taking on water to stop sinking.

Set sail on the winds of love's first inkling.



It's not that your critics are here to take,

But that they have other things to make:

They're simply self-interested, not fake.



Know what you'll accept, what you won't.

What doesn't mesh with you, do not promote.

What uplifts you completely, fully approach.



There is nothing else you need to acquire

In order to reach the place you've desired.

Your standards just needed to be higher.



When you don't know what comes next,

There's incredible power in your yes.

You dive in and give the unknown your best.



You get to go as deep as you will surrender,

Not to any club seeking its newest member,

But all the way in toward your own center.



No one else can exhale your air,

Or schedule your own self-care.

Decide, then put yourself there.



Unless they harmonize, the answer is no.

Because regarding where you wish to go,

It exists only for those who wish to know.



You can't be sure you're being understood.

So why not stop thinking that you should?

Concern yourself with your greatest good.



Enough trying to plan how this will go,

Because your future You already knows;

Make today's smallest choices your own.



You must do what is in your heart to do,

Which may not mean seeing it through,

But surely does mean starting in truth.



Always remember, it is rarely about you,

But about what they themselves are up to:

So, speak for yourself in regards to truth.



How much must change for this to work?

How much pain before there's less hurt?

Refuse all questions that are this absurd.



When are you at your happiest?

What makes you feel like this?

Where do you experience bliss?



Find a reason to laugh - any at all -

Even at risk of being guilty of gall.

Seriousness sits. Laughter sprawls.



Talking about compared to talking from

Is the difference between like and love:

Why not abide in your dreams of Above?



Pour all of your energy into this one spot.

Give one specific thing all that you've got.

Let it be where you bring all you brought.



Forget about what may happen after.

Forget about how to get there faster.

Forget about everything but laughter.



Have you ever focused all of your attention

On one target, one very specific intention?

Did your circle find it worthy of mention?



Give everything without counting the cost.

Give heedless of what's to be gained or lost.

Give for the passage you will have crossed.



Your best thinking will never compare

To your faintest feeling of being aware.

Your best mood helps your mind repair.



You do not need to think this through.

You need to limit distractions to a few,

And stop relearning old lessons anew.



Healing holds an irreplaceable place, but

Better than bad to good is good to great.

Begin. You cannot imagine what awaits.



All the lessons you choose to forget

Keep you a distance from what's next.

Rise to the occasion of your best yet.



Whatever you're ready to leave behind

Is likewise ready to escape your mind.

Once ready, it's just a matter of time.



All on their own, things will naturally jell.

So within details, you need no longer dwell.

The freedom you feel will naturally propel.



Are you thinking so much in order to decide?

Or is this a tactic to in thoughts safely hide?

This train of thought, you can no longer ride.



Better choices meet better choices,

So clear out the distracting noises

To clearly hear some wiser voices.



As much of a waste as it is to complain,

It is much more so to listen to the same.

Permanently put powerless pouting away.



Head in a direction - not in a circle.

Because this one truth is universal:

The life you live is not a rehearsal.



Not long after your thoughts improve,

Things that go on around you will too.

Review yesterday if you require proof.



Beware of talk that lingers on trauma.

Be mindful not to digest undue drama.

Be biased towards periods - not commas.



What's actually different, undeniably?

What will you now be doing, reliably?

What can be laid to rest, justifiably?



Before finishing what is now half begun,

You need to ask if it should even be done.

Your answer can't help but help everyone.



Let your answer to most offers today be no

Not for the sake of being defiant, but just so

Your yes will fully, unconditionally show.



Give what you have. Give without caution.

Give quickly, unconditionally - and often.

Give so you slowly and continually soften.



Narration is for books; you are living a life.

It wastes time, trying to explain away strife.

Spend your storytelling on describing light.



What are you lacking? (Nothing)

What are you usually discussing?

What are you slowly becoming?



You don't have to have a predestined intent.

You simply have to be a willing instrument,

And you'll enjoy day-sized enlightenment.



The laying of groundwork is vital -

So you don't repeat your last cycle.

May you build in an upward spiral.



Your gut has volumes to teach your brain

About how to release and what to retain.

Digestion is the most perfect daily frame.



Does the answer elude your concentration?

Maybe because you're chasing confirmation:

Find your freshest fountain of fascination.



What are you willing to sacrifice?

Just what leaves you feeling nice?

For what's priceless, pay full price.



They're allowed to react, but you must

Express from your heart with full trust

That truth comes when it's not rushed.



Getting in your own way is over now.

Forward, regardless of knowing how,

Await victories you once disallowed.



In the dark, many things may seem bright.

But walk with those who live in their light

And you will pick up speed and take flight.



Some offerings are, unfortunately, nonsense.

Around them erect a visible, warning fence

So that your forward flow can recommence.



Are you making an offering or a sacrifice?

One helps others, the other helps redefine

Who makes the offering - but from inside.



For now, stow your comfort and buckle down.

No time for anything too heady or profound.

Navigate these seas without making a sound.



Without rushing, can you still move swiftly?

For what's worse than colliding, is drifting.

So imagine something awaits your uplifting.



The more offers you gracefully decline,

The higher the next offerings will rise

(The one you accept is already inside).



Your greatest good simply isn't here yet.

But it's on its way - up from your depths.

What you say no to helps shape your yes.



You may dig to delve, or climb to rise;

Don't treat one as the other's disguise.

Dig to reach limbo, but climb to grow.



All you can do is take this next step.

Up, down, or over doesn't matter yet:

This isn't as good as it's going to get.



If you choose to forget what you've learned,

One of the bridges you built may get burned,

So account for all the wisdom you've earned.



Take better care of yourself. You truly must.

Anyone else treating you so, we'd call unjust.

Unschedule a whole day, sit back, and trust.



Not letting yourself reach out for help

Leaves others' offerings on their shelf.

Their giving + your gratitude = wealth.



Everything changes, it most surely does.

So whatever you fixate on rising above,

Allow instead, to receive all your love.



You serve no purpose but the one you make,

And you must always allow that to change.

Hear this: no two dawns are ever the same.



You've been dealt a marvelous favor,

Not a nuisance to put off until later.

What's en route is something greater.



The sooner you can reframe this situation,

The sooner you'll regain the determination

To make everything aid in your elevation.



Going without versus willfully indulging

Is quietly sitting versus loudly divulging.

By forgoing impulse, you end up exulting.



Is it about what the body can feel?

Do sensations decide what is real?

Is this yet one more layer to peel?



With a slight shift you realize that love

Treats everything as more than enough,

And has not one obstacle to rise above.



Setting today free from your stories

Lets others alike step into the glory

Of life above and beyond categories.



Enough of that endless, "...and then..."

Let busyness be a crime you condemn.

Free the day to spend time with them.



Every new thing you agree to do

Puts off the time needed for you

To graduate into deeper truths.



No need to comprehend all - just prepare.

Be where you should, instinctively there.

To do this, become more inwardly aware.



Your dreams so masterfully paint lessons

More vivid than daytime's best intentions.

Notice the details where dreams beckon.



Are you where you naturally thrive?

Do you feel that you are fully alive?

Do your strivings and settings jive?



Whether your speech speaks strength or strife

Will tell if you're building or battling inside.

Your commitment's quality decides your life.



The speed of your no strengthens each yes,

Closing off all but what should come next.

Wait with vigilance for what sounds best.



You get as much as you can handle, then

You get one measure more exactly when

You sacrifice caring about how it ends.



Every choice unlocks another door ahead.

Though you can always turn back, instead

Listen near each door - what's being said?



As for yesterday, it's not what you assume:

It is no more than a different today's tomb.

All it can ever do is fertilize today's bloom.



Yesterday has but one way left to serve you -

Showing how you think, feel, believe, and do

When on stage in a not-yet-tailored costume.



Yesterday is named for what it is not.

It can give what is gone (quite a lot).

And will happily hold all you forgot.



Yesterday does not have any advice for you,

It just echoes some of what was once true.

Find today's guidance in today's best group.



Ask your own yesterdays for very little -

Not because they've grown old or brittle,

But because they can be feisty and fickle.



Yesterday is not your greatest treasure,

Nor is it something by which to measure

Anything but the fact that today is fresher.



Yesterday has done all it could do

Based on the things that it knew.

Let today have nothing to prove.



What's left undone steepens fate's slope.

Owe tomorrow nothing - not even hope.

Level your life with a today-size scope.



Tomorrow is a novel idea,

But never quite gets here.

Yet today always appears.



What tomorrow holds is not your concern.

Since today is where you'll always return,

Presence is all you'll ever need to learn.



Tomorrow is like a kite in the wind,

Or a beach rock tossed so as to skim.

Today is an ocean you get to dive in.



Tomorrow will always say

That it is well on its way:

Put your energy in today.



Tomorrow is a feeling - not a fact,

So before getting yourself off track,

What about your today-size impact?



Along with its big-picture accomplices,

Let tomorrow offer its many promises;

Today has power your focus harnesses.



If yesterday's distractions are finally gone,

And tomorrow is not where focus belongs,

Then here and now is where you're strong.



Today has all you need -

Not a rulebook to heed,

But awareness, indeed.



Today has enough different parts to it

That there's room for everything to fit:

To what would you love to commit?



Today asks for everything you've got,

Except for things you've overthought.

Today offers you your very own spot.



Today needs you - regardless of the news.

Today already celebrates you, win or lose.

Today has every single thing you choose.



Today is a delicate balance

Between your many talents

And what your love wants.



Today belongs to your best habits,

So sacrifice every superficial status

For something-greater's apparatus.



Today is for rest.

What comes next?

Feeling blessed.



What's more powerful than power? Belief.

What's deeper than belief? Your instinct.

What's more natural than instinct? Love.



Because you have no interest in a meander,

Meet each new friend as a question's answer:

Take the invitation to raise your standards.



Before you jump to any dramatic conclusions,

Acknowledge the realities, not the illusions -

Forget the events and focus on your solution.



There would be no need for recovery

If you treated yourself more lovingly:

Make your own best ways compulsory.



Short-term perspectives dodge work.

There's always some duty they shirk.

Being thorough is far from a quirk.



Who pays attention when you're focused?

Who listens to you - and listens closest?

Entrust them based on what you notice.



If they tend to gossip or fuss, move along.

If they live to question or ponder, pass on.

If they faithfully contribute, you belong.



Like-minded peers await your arrival,

Others focusing beyond mere survival,

Those who, like you, serve and thrive.



What upsets you is pointing out something,

So stay here with it - without succumbing.

What would you choose to be becoming?



If you feel your old standards are the same,

Then they've fallen (things have changed):

Your standards must be constantly raised.



When it gets difficult is when it counts.

When your best inner resistance mounts

Is when your reasons must be announced.



Just for today, do your very best,

As if Future You gave you a test.

Draw from your deepest depths.



Once you name it, it's pronounceable.

Once you say it, you're accountable.

Once you face it, it's surmountable.



They'll come to you from everywhere.

Some will delight. A few might scare.

You're meeting yourself - so prepare.



You are connected to everything,

Even to people you'll never meet.

You touch without having to reach.



You'd never consider them an enemy,

Yet they distract you quite endlessly.

You should limit them, respectfully.



Is it actually procrastinating?

Or last-minute rearranging?

Busy doing or busy-making?



Understanding why you do what you do

Is intertwined with when you do it, too.

Better reasons do put time to better use.



While you can share all of your wealth,

Your wellness belongs to you yourself:

Only you know today's wholest health.



Tomorrow is nothing more than an idea -

Always on its way, but never actually here.

Your today however, has already appeared.



Not one yesterday is as you think it was.

All of your yesterdays viewed from above

Paint a mosaic of your journey with love.



While your reasons do frame everything,

Your reasons are born from questioning:

Think most about what's strengthening.



Trust can be earned, and trust can be spent.

Trust should be owned - but never be lent.

Trust proven results, not promised intent.



How much of what you did today mattered?

How much has left your attention scattered?

What one thing made you feel like a master?



You've done amazing work. Recognize this.

But for what's to come? It's the slightest hint.

Take some new chances that didn't used to fit.



Congratulations on what you've done so far.

But don't assume the future has to be hard.

Easefully await friends you highly regard.



Gratitude might gain you more than grit

By greeting rather than growling to get -

Instead of pushing, to graciously permit.



What you long for immediately limits you

To the frame that it's likewise attached to:

Leave the frames - unleash this next You.



If you will wait while all of this unfolds,

You will enjoy internal treasures untold,

The rewards of you surrendering control.



Knowing what you could've done but didn't,

You'll do better, so long as you're not flippant

About where you need to be more proficient.



You are building one beautiful life

By strengthening a structure inside

That daily supports how you decide.



You will need to be so clear

About what you allow here

En route to all you revere.



People appreciate you, they absolutely do.

Whether they relay it, it's absolutely true.

So, thank you - for being absolutely you.



Let humor be healing

So what you're feeling

Is your story repealing.



Talking about the wrong thing, are you?

While it's better than a blatant mistruth,

Instead of engaging, you can also refuse.



Certain conversations are beneath you.

While this may sound elitist or rude,

This is no time for roundabout news.



Withhold your comments,

Regardless of the contents.

Composure is deeply honest.



What activates you and doesn't let go?

What gives you energy and endless flow?

Do what asks for as much as it bestows.



This isn't time to stop and tally the score.

It's time to regroup, rally, and give more.

Sacrifice everything you're calling yours.



Whatever you give, you equally receive,

But what you sacrifice, you get to leave

As you outgrow who you now perceive.



Regardless of whether it feels nice,

Sacrifice, sacrifice, truly sacrifice.

If you must vent, at least be concise.



Your inner compass's direction is clear,

Telling you exactly which way to steer.

Correct course, but find why you veered.



First, you'll believe, then you'll know.

Then, what goes against will simply go.

Then, you'll wake up having... grown.



At some point, you'll be done tweaking.

You'll fix everything that was creaking.

May you know peace before completing.



Listening to each organ trying to tell you

In its own unique way, its own unique truth

Is a lot, so today just focus on one or two.



You can realize your dreams from right here

(This is the best place to begin - to be clear).

What should you create versus commandeer?



How do you receive an apology?

Just deflect it as "unnecessary?"

Or accept it with true humility?



Are you putting your perspective first?

For their needs, that may be the worst,

For no genuine answer can be coerced.



Regardless of plans or sharpened skill,

Today's going to feel exactly as it will

(Today, let a peace of patience fulfill).



Leave yourself with no place to hide.

Nudge yourself to step into the light.

Move in the direction that is bright.



You're better at it than you were yesterday

Because you can choose to see it this way.

Let this be the feeling your life conveys.



Before you start setting limits,

Take today's chance to give it

Conscious hours, not minutes.



Just around the corner, you will behold

Things you never imagined would unfold

That happen when you exert less control.



Go as far as you can, and then continue

Just around the corner of what's in you

To what had to be here to convince you.



It doesn't matter how you feel

If you're driven by an ideal that

Is more important than any ordeal.



There is no opponent you need to outsmart.

Let them be accountable to their own heart.

It only matters that you've done your part.



Let your tranquility

Lead to discovering

Living authentically.



Any of this belong in the marketplace?

In their hustling and bustling rat race?

Or in your most meaning-filled space?



Why complain that it's all insurmountable?

Why judge them when you're accountable?

Why not make faith in yourself allowable?



When selling, there's a desired outcome.

When sharing, by starting, you're done.

When is it best to be doing which one?



At what point will you have done enough?

At what point will there be no more stuff?

At what point will busywork be rebuffed?



Whether it takes years to regroup,

A loop is a loop is a loop is a loop,

So get yourself out of yours soon.



Shine inner light where it's dreary.

Push past your first wave of weary.

Trust all will reveal itself clearly.



Do you need to know to appreciate? No.

Would you rather know or grow? Grow.

Do all those who know, do? No? So, go.



Don't get so fixated on the details

That your follow-through flails:

Just be aware of what it entails.



Sit back and enjoy each situation.

It requires very little preparation:

A moment to moment dedication.



Circumstances cannot disappoint,

Charlatans cannot exploit where

Certainty has chosen to anoint.



Get out in nature. This isn't debatable.

Do so each day, earlier or perhaps later

To commune with something greater.



Wherever it is you wish to go

Begins here, so start the show.

Today is your theater, bestowed.



Where can you reach without starting here?

Perhaps many shortcuts claim to lead near,

But the long way is scenic as well as clear.



You are too deep in the details -

Come up for air before you flail.

A focus free of minutiae prevails.



You haven't reached the season's ending,

So take time to do some fence mending

For the beautiful garden you're tending.



Proceed with this as an indicator:

If it cannot be done a little later,

You're being used as a facilitator.



Today adds to your life's account.

Today is every tomorrow's sprout.

Today has time to figure this out.



Stop needing things to go your way.

That is more childish than naivete.

Even a rooted tree knows to sway.



Be as honest as you possibly can,

Unless they refuse to understand

Regardless of the given timespan.



They've given you all the necessary clues

- All yours to lay out, rearrange, then use:

Now make options from which to choose.



Detours won't simply yield to your new ways.

They'll offer the old ones to lead you astray.

Your only concern is what you choose today.



When words repeat, nothing new is said.

When patterns repeat, dimness spreads.

Do everything you do freshly instead.



You cannot reinvent the day every day.

In fact, invite your best habits to stay.

Build strength upon strength this way.



Ice turns to water when the rain pelts.

But add sun to rain, and faster it melts. 

Doing things in the right order helps.



Afterwards, you may need to recalibrate,

To reestablish your inner working range

That goes from good to genuinely great.



Beforehand, do something to calibrate

Your own overall sensitivity's range -

Be sure it can go from good to great.



Is it just to hear yourself say the words?

It is a good thing this thought occurred.

But find the feeling that all of this stirs.



After as many years as you dedicate,

There'll be yet more to investigate,

Continually inviting you to elevate.



What you set out to change, changes you.

You'll learn and grow from your pursuit,

Slowly unrecognizable from your debut.



What you ignore has not released its hold.

So don't assume you're free of its control.

Let all of its daily appearances be exposed.



Weather stormy thoughts and raging emotions

To brave the wonder of your vast inner ocean.

What you'll discover is worth the commotion.



Given the gift of time, you must choose

Between all of the things you could do,

And the ones that will let you improve.



How will you get better but by doing?

Not through study or dry reviewing,

But only by independently pursuing.



All is revealed when you ask sincerely,

Because earnestness is so endearing to

Those with words well worth hearing.



You will fall down, if you haven't yet.

This is nowhere for your mind to set:

Up is where you must immediately get.



The answer you seek is already here.

The way you should take, very clear.

The fork in your road is quite near.



Consider how you feel around them.

What about you do they reflect best?

Something you'd like to put to rest?



The decision is never much harder than this:

There's a way that works or the way that fits.

Separate yourself from the crowd. That's it.



You are never meant to feel obligated.

On the contrary, feel fully celebrated.

Now, which choice gets illuminated?



There is no need to fret wondering which.

Beyond the fact that you can always switch,

There is only actually one that will enrich.



It will never be their decision to make,

For you stand guard at your own gate in

Regards to choosing if you will partake.



Like claiming that to climb you need walls,

Needing the circumstances to change is false.

Within yourself, you are in control of it all.



Conversations that dodge or loop

Bring you right to Nowhere New.

Relocate your time to Better Use.



It would be better to be in solitude

Than continue in their talking loop.

Like the sunrise, speak forever new.



Surely, you can put aside your questions

For the sake of what you rarely mention,

And give that some undivided attention.



What's ridiculous? Expecting a result.

All the energy that that folly engulfs

Could be used on your ability to trust.



What's around you is likely within, too.

Our world is often our thoughts' proof.

What goes? What stays? All up to you.



Your life is no mystery - be assured.

Since you get what you are, be more.

Embody absolutely all that you adore.



You shouldn't have to be sure to move ahead.

But standing still should instill some dread,

And momentum should immediately embed.



Sacrifice. Make a bold commitment.

Now do what you must to live up to it.

Thus, you've remade your environment.



The bad things you don't do may do more

Than the good in keeping your body pure.

Bad habits that never become will ensure.



Are you enjoying yourself, incredibly?

Do you feel more impactful, indelibly?

Do you know greater awaits, inevitably?



Do you love who you get to work with?

If so, then you have truly discovered it -

Your fountain of youth and daily dip in.



Until your schedule fills the way you wish,

Do not, to any pleading or demands, submit.

They will learn to make your offering fit.



The secret to everything and anything is this:

Your attitude is what establishes the way it is,

So positivity is not optional - it's imperative.



Once you stop trying to tell this as a story,

Organizing all the details into an inventory,

You will experience today's beauty and glory.



Don't perpetuate that relationship -

It undermines the situation you're in

And who else you can associate with.



Learn your surroundings, but don't mimic.

What you shouldn't ever become is a cynic.

Find the best path through and/or clear it.



Know your surroundings as best as you can.

Where you can't find proof, formulate a plan.

It's not about what you already have in hand.



Without good, you never get to grand.

The brightest idea isn't an actual plan.

Learning isn't knowing. Understand?



You are made up of the infinitesimal,

Yet hold in each atom, the universal.

Your ability outdoes comprehensible.



Face what you sense will challenge you,

Not because you have anything to prove,

But to enjoy the practice - win or lose.



Stillness isn't air that's lacking a breeze

(Focusing on what's missing is a disease):

Focus on what's here so you feel healthy.



Lay out the rules as you need them to be.

Things will go along almost effortlessly.

Provided you brave the way, impartially.



Spend a bit longer working out details,

Not out of fear that any piece of it fails,

But to be aware of everything it entails.



Enough thought - it is time to act.

You don't need one additional fact.

By getting out there, you attract.



What you seek, you accidentally repel.

Water is everywhere and you are a well.

What you need to hear, you must tell.



By needing, you're pushing it away

So it can return, rather than stay.

"Need" as little as you can today.



When your goal is difficult, you reach.

Succeed or not, the journey does teach

Who's a supporter versus who's a leech.



There is a range within which to move.

Find and operate inside of this groove.

Abilities should be consciously used.



The reasons should match your bigger plan,

Yet not be overly complex, nor too bland,

But solid enough to independently stand.



Change comes for all we hold dear.

Change exists to make this so clear:

Unstick yourself (Do not adhere).



Pay attention to the correct clues,

Otherwise the best path will elude.

Focus on what resonates with you.



It's not about ignoring the inconvenient.

It's about being efficient and expedient:

It's all about the positive ingredients.



How do you prep for what you don't know?

You surrender to today's direction and flow.

Meeting the unexpected is the way you grow.



You're linked to everyone you're fond of,

Which is why they just descend from above

Mere moments after you send them love.



Your outlook makes all things possible.

You don't even have to be methodical:

Just deem every dimension crossable.



You're overthinking it again.

Use your heart, not your head.

Intuition is your best friend.



You have made some incredible decisions,

As well as some needing multiple revisions.

And so, you have an abundance of wisdom.



You're capable of more than you know.

With effort and ease in the right ratio,

Everything you choose will be apropos.



Try feeling this out instead.

With intuition as your friend,

You will be what's up ahead.



It can be difficult to understand if you try.

Answers come when you stop wondering why

And just choose a set of standards to abide by.



It may take a while to arrange everything.

But once you have, harmony begins to ring

And things that clutched, no longer cling.



Sometimes you climb, not up, but across.

Quiet any and all unproductive thoughts,

And make your way around or else, off.



It may end up taking more time than planned.

That is no cause for you to add your demands,

It is an opportunity for patience to expand.



Time makes effort compound

Into experiences that resound

From how deeply you ground.



If you haven't already heard this,

Combine self-love with alertness.

Hold yourself in flexible firmness.



Your body has some issues to reckon.

So once you've done a quick check-in,

Curl up when the occasion beckons.



You're long overdue for some quiet,

Some good, old-fashioned silence,

A strict, uninterrupted word diet.



Stop. Interrupt yourself mid-conversation

To ensure you're consciously engaged in

Hearing, not patiently-veiled persuasion.



There is something to be said for temper,

Knowing where, when, how to let it enter;

When it's a destroyer instead of a defender.



What's important, and what is not?

Figure this out or end up fraught

Instead of having what you sought.



Nothing's wrong - not the way you assume.

You just need to examine your own attitude

For wherever it's clinging to a fixed mood.



Rushing when your body asks you to relax

Has this among a long list of drawbacks:

Rushing has no idea what else it impacts.



Procrastinating when your body says, "Go!"

Is the way you cause vital systems to slow,

So, to whatever asks if you'll delay: "No."



It may have worked just yesterday,

But your standard's suddenly raised:

That must immediately be cast away.



Be as positive as you can be with this,

And that will uplift your spirits a bit,

And that will invite more positivity in.



Shift one degree closer toward the light,

One degree more in the direction of bright.

One degree isn't too drastic, it's so slight.



The way you frame life decides everything -

From your approach, to your own longevity.

Don't just be - to the utmost positively, be.



How do you choose to view the day's events?

As haphazard happenings that fate invents?

A beautifully synchronized coincidence?



Before those thoughts start their swirling,

Consider this your early weather warning:

Forgive yourself, first thing in the morning.



Through it all, be sure you're having fun.

It's the best beginning and final outcome.

Nothing else is worth working to get done.



Beware of every preexisting track.

Wise to suspect some nearby trap,

Keep an open door at your back.



Intensity is a flame that burns out,

Limited water coming from a spout,

A force to be controlled throughout.



Some challenges are not meant to be yours.

Well-packaged, glorified, pawned-off chores

Are nowhere your energy needs to be poured.



It may not feel like you're being intense,

But it's always good advice to go get rest,

Whether you unplug, detox, nap, or stretch.



If they're the same jokes on a different day,

The laughter is likewise stale, sorry to say.

Invite your sense of humor to rise / change.



Get out of groups that feel like a clique.

For this, there is no magical technique.

Leave in the light of day - don't sneak.



No, it cannot all be done at once.

By striving, you make it a stunt.

Put your patience here in front.



You light up a room with love,

And in case that isn't enough,

You leave it well-thought-of.



You brighten all with your loving greeting;

Everyone wants to be who you're meeting,

And the afterglow of it is far from fleeting.



Even if your joints begin to hurt,

There is a key joy in shared work

That unlocks a sharing of worth.



You're allowed a sense of nostalgia,

But don't let it drag on for hours...

Here now is where you have power.



Being too serious might embarrass you

Once levity saunters around the room.

Loosen your grip. Lighten your mood.



How ever it gets done, don't be attached.

Your job was just to get the idea hatched.

The rest is in everyone's hands after that.



Even if the risks appear appalling,

Rise to meet your highest calling.

Your journey will be enthralling.



Look past all that is shiny.

What's superficial is tiny.

What's within you, mighty.



It is good to be precise when asked,

But unless you enjoy being so exact,

Spend more time on how you relax.



The chase of any thing will grow old.

The novelty wears off all on its own.

Instead of chasing, simply behold.



Appointments frame each day's design. 

Being punctual honors the gift of time.

Give and receive this respect in kind.



In situations where the mind sincerely ought,

Emotions aren't to be substituted for thought

Lest in a debate's net you'd like to be caught.



Instead of splintering your time further,

Consider what longer stretches are worth.

Dedicate in hours to what you love first.



You're doing all the right things now -

You know what you're doing, and how,

As well as who you will and won't allow.



Trying to please everyone is irresponsible,

Because you will end up sacrificing logical

To make a new problem that's unresolvable.



A child doesn't track time like you do,

So is their today any more or less true?

Could you have their detached sense, too?



You assume you have the right question,

But that assumption is worth mention:

Your answer is a whole new dimension.



When you fall behind your own quota,

Don't fret about that (not one iota).

Faithfully stay positive and devoted.



What happened when you tried it like that?

Did your most important goal go off track?

If so, note the power of each individual act.



This is a perfect time to engage

The power of your nimble brain

To point to what ever changed.



You don't know what you think you do.

You only have the amount of mental fuel

That your spirit knows it needs as proof.



When you decide, you set in motion

A universe of options, new notions,

And a whole new level of devotion.



Regardless of what you're able to believe,

You can do more than you as yet conceive

Because now, you're more able to just be.



You want to share, but keep going!

You're in the middle of growing...

Nature's not yet done bestowing.



You are getting close to your next turn,

But keep going straight, unconcerned.

You will very soon be able to discern.



Some of your habits need to depart -

Especially ones that quiet your heart.

Agreeing to this is the perfect start.



Just that quickly, you're thinking too much.

You've skidded sideways and down into a rut.

Get back up. Have yourself think just enough.



You're too busy trying to decipher meaning.

No point in worry - your body's now healing.

Focus on cultivating your very best feelings.



It's not an unending grind -

It's just too much combined:

Handle one thing at a time.



There is only one way to do it all,

The way is proven (It is actual) -

Tackle a thing at a time, gradual.



That is enough thought about that.

Even if you claim to deal in facts,

What might hyperfocus attract?



Give yourself some room to relax.

When you're done get right back,

With fresh perspective, to the task.



Extract yourself out of the middle,

Because your role is too superficial.

If you can't easily pivot, then swivel.



Time is your impartial judge.

Beg for more, it won't budge.

Ignore it, and it will nudge.



Growth is available to you constantly.

In precious bits, not large quantities.

Present yourself to the day honestly.



The years will pass whether you grow or not.

Many will decline the chance, but you ought

To take every single opportunity to be taught.



You can do more than you imagine in a year,

Or you can try as hard to remain right here.

You choose, but greatness is going to appear.



Put the right people together - then leave.

They will figure out everything they need.

What's there is for them, not you, to achieve.



Expect all you wish, but you would be wise

To drop expectation and its every disguise.

The unexpected loves when you improvise.



Declaring what you will and won't do

Is one way, but gets in your way, too.

How much you give is what to choose.



What if you offered more than you have?

Then you would notice the stark contrast

Between what you can create versus amass.



Attitude is the main factor,

The most effective attractor

Of what you're chasing after.



Congratulations, you got yourself here.

Everyone who helped, you brought near.

This is all the work of you being sincere.



Even when you attempt to doubt,

A twinkle of light still peeks out.

You have confidence throughout.



No, it's not even a bit preposterous.

Yes indeed, you'll have to pardon us:

We find you remarkable, marvelous.



Evaluators can miscalculate.

Judgements can be inaccurate.

Your presence is immaculate.



Though they thought it miscellaneous,

You have always had this deep radiance.

This is your leeway to be spontaneous.



No, it is never too late

To accept just how great

You are. Yes, every trait.



If there's nothing you plan to be doing,

You don't get to say a storm is brewing.

To prepare everyone, just start choosing.



Without any awareness of world news,

Your body knows enough to keep you

Surviving, thriving: you live as proof.



Every moment, every breath,

Your body does what's next

Without complaint or stress.



Are you falling behind what you expected?

Do you fret that your goals seem neglected?

The time was not wasted if you connected.



Something you do all the time, any routine,

Can be treated as unique, dry as it may seem -

Your own daily ritual that honors the unseen.



Whether or not you got selected,

If you worried of being rejected,

Assure your heart it is protected.



Keep working, without counting down.

Keep focused, without looking around.

Keep listening for your distant sound.



You're almost there - atop your peak -

Among those you dreamed you'd meet.

Stay focused, refine your technique.



It gets closer via the passage of time,

Closer thanks to each day going by:

Does it feel useful wondering why?



Your concern should be on your technique,

On the way you do what you do as you seek,

Because that is what makes you so unique.



Do you prefer planning forever?

Or are you up for the endeavor?

If so, get out into the weather!



Are you waiting for a better reason?

Or perhaps a more favorable season?

Today is when to sow your seeds in.



Be specific, stop being general.

Be long-lasting, not ephemeral.

Be wholly one you, not several.



Stop being general. Be specific.

You will feel focused, terrific,

And so effective you're prolific.



Though it may seem counterintuitive,

The only new news that's informative

Is how much you'll sacrifice to give.



Change to give, not receive, more.

Change yourself. Open new doors.

Change even what you're here for.



What is the right thing to focus on?

Which things are definitely wrong?

Where does your attention belong?



If you want what you have, you know joy.

If you're content, even with what annoys,

You will be someone who disease avoids.



Move things out of the way

In order clear proper space

To practice every single day.



You're only granted a license to complain

About that which you're working to change,

So on all other subjects be upbeat in frame.



What you do most often, defines you.

It's not the things you intend to do,

Your daily practices are your proof.



No one else knows what it's all about.

Take some time to figure things out.

You tend to be your own best scout.



Leave time after you awake

To let your dreams reshape

What they tried to relate.



It won't go as you imagined,

So go get yourself unfastened

From stories of what happened.



It's not that the deadline was off or wrong,

It's that to many who need you, you belong.

Be kinder to yourself than to the throngs.



Don't go get yourself wrapped up too tight;

You'll have so many chances to get it right.

You'll surely shine (Your shine is bright).



Do one healthy amount of preparation,

Then a healthier amount of relaxation,

And you'll transcend the examination.



Let us talk about your self-talk.

Is it a noisily nagging squawk?

Or more like a meditative walk?



Would others call your self-talk healthy?

Does it go on about making you wealthy?

Or discuss something more compelling?



Sometimes, self-talk will be the only voice

Heard, whether by circumstance or choice.

So ask it to say things to make you rejoice.



Precisely how often do you talk to yourself?

Do you hear more often from someone else?

Does just how often you self-talk tattle/tell?



It's very important - your self-talk style.

Are you only encouraging once in a while?

Or do you every day make yourself smile?



Self-talk will make so much difference.

It will give your mind daily deliverance

From overthinking into magnificence.



Self-talk will be for you

Like your best friend who

Knows how to get through.



Your self-talk has to uplift,

Otherwise, you get rid of it

(Silence can also be a gift).



Were you talking to yourself right now?

If so, was it irreverent, respectful, how?

Were the voice your aide, might it bow?



How you talk to yourself needs some work.

First and foremost, it should rarely hurt,

And it should celebrate all of your quirks.



How you talk to yourself is critical.

First of all, it must never be cynical,

Always more loving than analytical.



How you talk to yourself today

Will easily have the most sway

Over whether it goes your way.



There's mighty power in self-talk styles,

Such as being able to make yourself smile

As you traverse or transcend today's trials.



When talking to yourself, be kind -

To all your shortcomings, be blind;

With all your strengths, be entwined.



Talk to yourself as you would to a child:

Be light, free, loving, interested, mild.

Be fun - let your imagination run wild.



Talk to yourself as you would a best friend.

Let your thorough honesty and rigor extend

To all areas, with integrity that won't bend.



Claiming that there is power in money

Is silly. It should sound odd or funny.

True power is being bright and sunny.



But what do you actually need?

Yes, that one's the voice to heed

(not about amount, but speed).



Bright and shining still casts a shadow

Over those waiting outside your glow.

Let them be. They know better. Glow.



Daybreak is the first sign of sunrise.

Peace is the first sign of being wise.

Love is the first sign you're a light.



What can trouble you when you're at ease?

Only you can permit inner peace to leave.

Keep your gate guarded, your lock clean.



Trouble doesn't barge in - it's invited

By a part of you that says it's entitled.

Make sure more of you stands undivided.



You don't need some immaculate recovery.

You're loved because of your vulnerability,

So just brave parts of your process openly.



Though kind of you to be so available,

Sometimes you need to be unassailable

To work on something this scalable.



You couldn't comprehend just how much

And how often they send you their love.

Just trust that you are well thought of.



They've been sending their love for years,

Beyond words, physical presence, and tears

As pure energy, for they still hold you dear.



You are beloved. It will always be so,

From some you may never even know,

But your intuition hears their hello.



That part is getting ready to end.

And what will you be doing then?

This part calls for a new friend.



Do exactly what's in you to do, do no more.

Stay put until you feel the need to explore.

Reject things you no longer wish to endure.



Even people you met once - and never again -

They appreciate that you were there for them.

So how much more so, your longtime friends!



You are beloved, for no particular cause,

Except possibly that what originally was

A title became so much more than a job.



Just one more - that's what's often asked.

What if that just one more was the last?

It never is, until you truly move past.



Without one extra doing to speak of,

You keep attracting ever more love.

Does this hint that you're enough?



You're being given daily proof

That there's still more to you

Than your mind can deduce.



There is darkness - ignore it or don't.

Where light loves to travel, it won't.

Dark as it gets, your light will approach.



Fear of losing your things, gains you none.

Clutching many things, loses you the one.

When you let go marks when you've begun.



Light adds to light or shines in the dark.

Every light is meant to play its own part.

Shine where doing so warms your heart.



No job will make you whole.

No medal can pin to your soul.

No achievement isn't already old.



You're being spoken to by everything -

Passers-by, coincidences, even dreams.

Even today is far more than it seems.



Everything is speaking to you,

But not everything speaks truth.

Intuition will be your sleuth.



Your good deeds have left an impression.

Rather than leaving them with a question,

You gave answers - a generosity lesson.



Who you are will keep changing

Since you keep on reengaging

What feels most sustaining.



Rise. May you continue to rise unendingly.

Rise above those who deal condescendingly.

Rise without apology. You rise relentlessly.



Can't breathe tomorrow's air to save time,

Don't try to jump to the front of the line.

Enjoy the view (Stop rushing the climb).



Pain arrived, but was unable to stay

Because you did not feed it dismay.

It left because you starved it away.



Like wildflowers in a meadow,

Or grass on a rainswept knoll,

What you focus on will grow.



Hurrying will do no one any good. 

Even if you safely, soundly could,

It's not a reason you ever should.



You're being cared for. It looks like this.

Even when you're sure the parts don't fit,

Back up to appreciate the whole mosaic.



There are steps, if you seek a paved path.

Otherwise, you could walk across the grass

And head straight into the forest, at last.



Stop right here - don't keep going.

Please be stopping, not just slowing

So nothing but time is still flowing.



Prepare. Know what you're going to do

When the unexpected "surprises" you.

Frame the day with your deepest truth.



Don't underestimate your opposition.

To find out what you need, just listen.

To make use of it, become a tactician.



Some people cast a long shadow.

Stay out of it, if you're to grow.

Get close to light's nearest glow.



Beware of situations that swirl -

Rather than stay flat, they curl.

Go, before the rest of it unfurls.



Be flattered if you like, but stay sober

Lest you be considered the pushover.

Get all you came for. Call it closure.



You know what you're doing - they don't.

You put the quality time in - they won't.

You get to calm the crisis they provoked.



Everyone is doing the best they can,

Except when they pile on demands.

That belies limited-vision plans.



And now to ponder - what if you're wrong?

Would you have done it this way all along?

Contemplation makes your judgment strong.



You can say it's too much, that you quit.

But that certainly won't be the end of it

Till you know how to positively commit.



If you keep finding yourself in this spot,

You keep receiving what you've brought.

What is it that you finally need to stop?



How do you handle this? You do it yourself.

For now, it's the way because you need help

With other situations that all this has dealt.



You're doing great - fantastic even.

You're someone people believe in

Beyond what you're achieving.



You're nearing the close of this chapter

In the book of seeking what you're after.

The surprise was that you're the attractor.



Be against what you're against, but open.

Be for what you're for, yet do note when

Your spirit of change needs to be awoken.



Ideally underfoot - but good enough if not -

Physically touch the ground. If you cannot,

Go inward to your mind's ideal nature spot.



That gathering may not be for you,

Or it may be exactly the one to do.

Check all the things they're into.



If they are not at least as earnest as you,

You'll stick to the lower level of the two.

The power of association works like glue.



Do you know how they start their day?

If they begin it in too different a way,

You're leading one of you two astray.



Do yourself a favor extraordinaire:

Before you start supporting their

Cause, notice what's in disrepair.



Like yours, their space gives clues

Into what ever they're really up to.

Don't judge, but do establish truth.



Beware when words don't match the deeds,

When requirements don't match the needs,

Or when you feel yourself caught in between.



The answers await - go outside.

Forget the things you've tried.

Nature is your patient guide.



Every day is supernatural,

Transcends the factual, and

Dares you to be impractical.



If they're always in distress,

You always know what's next.

Do the opposite, find success.



Get some fresh air, metaphorically too.

Breathing elevates your point of view,

Even more so when the scenery is new.



Make a decision, not for the outcome,

But to get the choosing by itself done.

Which is where the next sprouts from.



Change it all and get the same outcome,

Unless you find where it sprouts from:

Change only yourself (you're the one).



Don't pass along your crisis as a task

To someone, even if they offer or ask.

Own it fully, or it won't be the last.



A duty you have to yourself is to be brave,

To break free from being yesterday's slave

To give more of you than you ever gave.



What you've worked for and invited

Would love to see you so delighted.

It is time to start getting excited!



Not a slave to pains nor a servant of gains,

You are the enduring essence that remains

Open and loving, somehow more every day.



Let no labels box you into a space

That sends your blessings away.

Unpack more goodness each day.



Just because they prefer stories of past woe,

Doesn't mean that's the place you need to go.

You share, not to commiserate, but to grow.



Some of your blessings are only for you.

They were given to help things improve

Deep down inside so you can live true.



Each of your hardships played a key role

In growing you, each one asked your soul

If it wishes for you to be mostly or whole.



Are you actually feeling tired?

Or is it that you feel mired?

Try out feeling inspired.



Each conversation heads a direction

(It's not just some word collection).

To turn yours, find an intersection.



Examine your relationships. Do an audit.

If it is of mutual benefit, applaud it.

If it needs more to grow, repot it.



Be clear. Have you been? Extremely?

Or have you spoken only serenely?

Have you struck a chord? Deeply?



Be clear - but do not rant.

Repetition does not enchant,

Nor does clarity ever slant.



New energy brings hope, so welcome it.

Newness invites them to newly commit.

Even a tree's newest roots strengthen it.



The recipe relies on its ingredients

Good training relies on obedience.

Effectiveness relies on expedience.



Opportunities are just a trigger -

To get you to think even bigger,

And refill your heart with vigor.



Your support must also be fluid

To adjust to what gets included.

Holler if it ever feels diluted.



If everyone around you is looking elsewhere

For their next validating thing to compare,

You may need to get yourself out of there.



You will always love feeling connected,

Helpful, appreciated, well-respected, so

Why not travel the road you selected?



Both you and your methods should keep up

With how times change as they do and such,

The same way people change when in love.



It is inconvenient, but you can adjust

To what's now needed to sustain and such.

Once-good habits fail as today's crutch.



Healing is what you ultimately need,

But first, you have to get some relief

From what is stoking your disbelief.



Prepare all you might in the physical plane,

But when the time comes, it's energy's game.

You cannot shape the future. Be alive today.



Whom they consult with decides your fate

In things where you need to collaborate:

Detach from outcomes, latch your gate.



Open a drain, and that's what it will do.

Open a door, some may walk over you.

Open a heart, you have a breakthrough.



True connections are your greatest treasure,

Your greatest protection from any weather,

Your stockpile of loving beyond measure.



Leave, having given your level best.

Leave while you still own your zest.

Leave with heart asking what's next.



Looking around rather than within

Makes it so that even when you win,

You'll be unsure if you've ever been.



The falling of rain makes the ground wetter.

The writing of love makes a beautiful letter.

The passing of time makes good things better.



Rush, and you're guaranteed to ruin

What heart, head, or hand was doing.

To rush is to chase time's illusion.



Calm down and take it all in.

Calm down before you begin.

Calm down, under your skin.



What's happening in your heart?

Is it telling you to stop or start?

Is it asking you what's its part?



When you don't know, just wait.

Linger by your mind's front gate.

Out the back, let nothing escape.



Whether fraught with a feeling futility,

Or in awe of life's perfect unpredictability,

One truth awaits: What will be, will be.



If they bring along chaos to share,

It spreads quite quickly, so beware.

You overestimate what you can bear.



Don't bother opening that lid -

Regardless of whoever else did,

That is something you forbid.



Many will line your path, but not help.

Therefore, plan to take care of yourself

And be pleasantly surprised at all else.



An excuse is an excuse, a result is a result.

Know the difference, even if you must consult

With those who you wouldn't normally trust.



Forgive their excuses. Trust their actions.

Words swerve off. Deeds create traction.

Know the difference, know satisfaction.



The part of them that most annoys

Reflects where you lack of poise

Loving what you'd rather avoid.



When you're comfortable, is that when

You come out from your fenced-in pen?

Let yourself venture out well before then.



There are no rules that say so -

Just your own desire to slow

Down when you can grow.



For now, it is in the distance,

So if you feel any resistance,

There is time for assistance.



There is time to seek assistance

Handling what's in the distance

(Don't pretend it's nonexistent).



Be positive despite, then regardless

And gradually drop all the hardness

As you render the cause harmless.



Blame is a habit you must drop.

Pointing outward can now stop.

Own both sides - do not swap.



You're terrific before the day's beginning.

You're wonderful before you even do a thing.

You're perfect before the energy you bring.



Thinking isn't your enemy - believing it is.

No one thought can force you to submit to it.

Your power to believe will openly admit this.



You can think all you like, but honor time.

Overthinking can waste a day in its prime.

It's difficult to overthink and yet climb.



You deserve to feel immeasurably proud

For a lovely life you have lived out loud.

What incredible future have you aroused?



Yes, you should be exactly this proud,

For having the discipline to disavow

Everything but what focus allowed.



Learn from everything that can teach.

Live by a code - one you do not breach.

It is all possible. It is all within reach.



Focus on your strengths,

Then hire out the rest.

Do this until the end.



You don't have burnout from your calling -

It's unrelated minutiae you find appalling.

What one task feels endlessly enthralling?



What you do best is what you love most.

Why you love it is why you're engrossed.

When you love is when you're love's host.



Setting a goal starts the race.

Pursuing it sets the lead pace.

The finish is a self-embrace.



Don't be distracted by promises of speed,

Of faster ways to get to what you seek.

Patience, you're going to need belief.



What you're building asks for time

To pour the foundation, let it dry,

And raise upward, toward the sky.



The secret "shortcut" is a fool's path.

It goes a distance, then doubles back

And puts you behind where you're at.



Mix with what you neither respect nor trust,

And you erode your time like rain makes rust.

Your sole response should have been disgust.



Traveling a beach road lined with mansions,

Or to a resort beside a breathtaking canyon,

Do you focus on the limits or the expanses?



It's important to mention:

Facing the wrong direction

Disorients your intention.



The right question at the wrong time

Is like a word that cannot be rhymed,

Finding no room for one more new line.



Asking the wrong question at the wrong time

Is where most tumble, starting out the climb.

You must have a cliffside faith that is blind.



The wrong question at the right time

Is at best useful, and at worst, benign.

You'll know. Its answer won't align.



The right question at the right time

Has an answer that resounds sublime.

It makes everything feel designed.



Before the dawn, dim your light

To behold the precious sight

Of the ending of a night.



Showing up is certainly ideal.

No replica replaces life's real.

Presence is a whole being feel.



You'll go into it one way, but get ready.

If you're sincere, of service, and steady,

You'll be transformed - toes to... heady.



As indescribably wondrous as she is,

Mother Nature has her wishes. This:

That you'd be one of her witnesses.



There isn't always a profound reason

Behind what they're doing or feeling.

It may simply be randomness's season.



If you're looking for a deeper cause,

In this case, you may need to pause:

Not everyone has a conscious because.



Trust your gut, you're not delirious.

Emotion bundles up life experience

Into what's useful, but mysterious.



Being rational is highly overrated.

Rationale sits, endlessly debated.

Emotion gets up to get it created.



Inspiration is your whole life's fuel.

From circumstances, kind or cruel,

Inspiration draws constant renewal.



What you hold in, you don't let out.

What you let out, defies fearful doubt.

What you let in, tells what you're about.



Complaining closes doors around the corner.

If you fear the latter, then avoid the former.

If griping were a nation, remain a foreigner.



If you don't have a feeling about it,

Move on by, leave thought out of it.

When intuition tugs, never doubt it.



This is a moment to accelerate efforts,

Not so much you make your head hurt,

This is only your next book's preface.



When you tighten up your inner circle,

You shore up your own sense of worth

By ruling out the option of reversal.



Don't worry about reaching the limit yet.

Give everything, so you will never regret.

You're mediocrity's greatest living threat.



You don't have to be tired of it yet,

But a loop's a loop, lest you forget.

Get out entirely - don't just reset.



The right friends unlock the right doors

Within you. But remember, all are yours:

Some lead to challenges, some to chores.



If you got a glimpse of their inner strife,

You wouldn't wish for anyone else's life:

Only you can get yours to shine bright.



Have you ever hosted an inner celebration?

One that involved no guests or decorations?

One just gazing up at inner constellations?



Recharge, before you run out of inspiration.

Recharge through encouraging conversation.

Recharge through uncomplicated meditation.



If they put on airs

You'd best beware

What's afoot there.



When they arrive to you seeming glum,

It's not from anything you have done.

Just be love, light, and a bit of fun.



It is not your job to cheer anyone up.

You cannot fill an empty, broken cup.

But have fun for your own sake. Yup!



You won't always be as diplomatic,

But this is no cause to be dramatic:

Life is an adventure, not a schematic.



When responses begin to feel erratic,

Stop if they turn too melodramatic

(Try to make it sound diplomatic).



You have no idea what burdens they bear,

So if too close, get yourself out of there.

Not imperative to beware - but be aware.



You can only carry the load you bring,

So apologize, even if they're begging -

You're only built to carry one thing.



You have no idea what they're brewing,

So keep your distance while construing

Who, what, why they may be pursuing.



Your intuition cannot lie.

Disagree? Give it time.

It is honest, by design.



That "harmless" untruth does no good,

But point opposite of where it should.

Truth or nothing at all, understood?



Not knowing what any cabinet stores,

Don't go around opening cracked doors.

What they carry is no business of yours.



Adjust to your surroundings - adapt,

Or else you'll eventually be trapped:

The strategy is to respond, not react.



Are you pushing against a wall?

Are you processing that at all?

Done doing stubborn and small? 



What you miss of what you had, get it back

Some other way that keeps goodness intact.

You do not have to suffer to stay on track.



Their goals don't ever have to match any

Of yours, so no need to be condemning.

What goodness you both share is plenty.



Sometimes you do things because you must,

Out of family obligation, health, and such.

You're still going forward though. Trust.



There's a decision to make,

A strategic action to take,

A key milestone at stake.



Who do you think you'll talk to next?

Who could advise you better? Or best?

Who stays with you, breath by breath?



The marketplace disregards your passion.

It only cares about bargains and action.

The marketplace sells no satisfaction.



Value does not rush or waste.

Value is not bought in haste.

Value knows its valued place.



They're too jittery - back out now.

They're too jittery to even know how.

You stay calm while you disallow.



You're turning a corner soon,

Away from the petty picayune

To face something opportune.



How ever you choose your words to land,

Whether plain and simple or fancy grand,

Stop. You won't make them understand.



Being vague benefits no one.

Let the best words be chosen.

Put meaning out in the open.



Keep putting care into your work,

At very least, it will not hurt, and

At best? Some unexpected perks.



There is work and there are hobbies.

Think about what each one embodies.

Which has the most loving colleagues?



Being tight-lipped about your position

Might be a wise political decision, but

Puts your heart and head in opposition.



Start getting excited. It's getting closer!

You can even loosen up your composure.

Are you starting to feel happy all over?



Pack light, for the journey of today.

Trust what you need is on its way,

And that what doesn't come is okay.



Are you facing the right way?

Does it inspire a hearty hooray?

Or insist you delight and delay?



No one can add to or deplete your supply

Of pure essence - of what you are inside:

Relax and take everything in epic stride.



Process begets process, not peaceful rest.

Submit to their process, vanish in tests.

Free yourself from their processed mess.



Let your weakness be conceded,

What support needs to precede it?

Ask for help when you need it.



Changing your mind is the greatest strength

You can bring to every future predicament;

Just for today, what makes the most sense?



Every decision is backed by your past

Experiences, from first through to last.

Your history helps make decisions fast.



Which facts are now outdated?

Which feelings are overstated?

Balance will get this underway.



Have you let nature make a point?

Are you out listening for its voice?

From the sky above to beneath the soil?



There's plenty you need not put up with.

In fact, there's nothing you're stuck with.

You choose how everything gets conducted.



You deserve to be treated with respect

Regardless of how it's turned out yet.

Kindness has an amplifying effect.



Make your decision based on your gut.

It holds your past experiences, so trust

That you already, already know enough.



Make a decision based on your heart.

It's where your intuition gets its start.

If not solely, give it a contributing part.



Time to trust yourself more than you do,

To take all your life adventures in review:

Let the wisdom of experience guide you.



Decide based on what you know in sum,

General places they tend to come from,

As well as what they tend to become.



Not an ill to be conquered,

It's alright to feel awkward:

Be at peace being bothered.



Lean on the relationships you've built -

They stand on solid foundation, not silt.

You take time to level them with no tilt.



What's the best way to make a decision?

Basing it on what makes you feel driven?

Or what dares you to give the most given?



Time to stop treating it as secondary.

What you have built is so necessary.

In time, it will be truly legendary.



If you took a break from diminishing,

Things would get genuinely interesting.

For starters, you'd finally be finishing.



Know what you have, yet be humbler.

Find no comfort among the grumblers.

Become Dedication's loudest trumpeter.



To have a full understanding of who you are

Is too much to expect just based on how far

You've wandered. Let's raise your inner bar.



Straightforwardness need not be skewed:

Before delivery, check your own attitude.

There's being direct, versus being rude.



Sometimes your disobedience is essential

To unlock an unknown bit of potential,

Whose ripple effect will be exponential.



You're trying too hard, clutching your goal.

Release your grip, awaken your sleeping soul.

Deep, unattached alertness makes you whole.



Most things aren't worth your time -

Eager as it is, even your busy mind's.

Put most of what's before you, behind.



Let this note dryly remind:

Most of all that is designed

To waste most of your time.



Put it behind you, it is a waste

Of your own good sense and taste.

With pure goodness get it replaced.



A waste time is a waste of space.

Therefore, take yourself away, to

Find or create a genuine place.



For some periods, you will need to lean.

It's necessary for those times in between

Where you were and what's yet to be seen.



Trouble does not affect the centered.

Once you get your radius protected,

Move to the middle of contented.



Distractions do not diminish

Until you're definitely finished

With loving life at a distance.



Wander as deep as you dare into it.

What are they doing when they do it?

Soon you'll see you just outgrew it.



Let the decision settle in

Before you meddle with it.

It's no time for adrenaline.



For all of that last choice's flaws,

It beat sitting licking your paws,

And you've yet to know all it was.



You don't know where this heads,

But keep going - the path spreads,

Leading to many new dear friends.



Let the decision run its course

Before doing something premature.

For now, just provide support.



Everything you attempt to control

Will rent that much of your soul.

Thus once more, just let it all go.



To the degree to which you surrender

Your roles of gatherer and/or spender,

You'll live today's life with splendor.



Magnificent. You, nothing short of that,

Summited those challenging peaks at last,

And mastered the art of thorough and fast.



Whether you choose to hunt or to gather,

You need to know just what you're after,

And what en route to doing so, matters.



The clues are truly all around,

From sights to telltale sounds.

What have you already found?



You can give up the search whenever,

Enjoy today's inner and outer weather,

And answer all else with, "Whatever."



Accept that that choice is now behind you.

You've explored all the options, old to new.

With this new plan, you're moving on, too.



Whether tempted to cry, rage, or whine,

What's needed is some contemplative time:

Clarity helps all the emotions fall in line.



Who can say how it should be

Without better understanding

Of what it is you truly need?



Who can say how it should go

Without understanding flow,

Or how much you can grow?



Imagine you're already legendary:

Which habits would you just bury?

What would be your extraordinary?



If their answer contains discouragement,

Find out where their courage went. Oh,

And get yourself good soul nourishment.



Goodness does not require.

Greatness does not expire.

Passion does not retire.



Let them earn your trust slowly,

And the reason for this is mostly

That time shows people wholly.



If someone gives their trust immediately,

It is likely they have done so previously,

Rather than cultivating a bond tediously. 



You're allowed to get tired. Get some rest.

If anyone disturbs you, it's a sort of test

To see how well you convey one request.



Once you've identified your adversary,

Having bitterness is fully unnecessary,

But bluntness? Be fully discretionary.



They're following their own agenda.

For now, they don't know any better.

Thus, don't bother getting offended.



They present to you who they are - accept.

They're so clear there's no need to check.

They don't even ask you to be that adept.



Frustration only injures you,

So have it pass right through

Without so much as an adieu.



Carry on with what you were doing.

As they're childishly misconstruing,

You continue your steady pursuing.



Your body quietly guides your mind

With all it's working on deep inside.

Your mind flits. Your body provides.



What do you do to stay fresh?

Go outside? Exercise? Rest?

Do it daily and nevertheless.



Take a step back, or rise overhead.

If you don't do it now, then when

Will you devote the time instead?



Sorry to say so, but indecision spreads.

May this leave you with a healthy dread

And reconnect you to decisive friends.



Who are the happiest people in your life?

Whose dreariness deserves drastic decline?

With whom do you feel distinctly divine?



Curious, does your most recent "worst"

Overshadow the previous, or the first?

Do your rankings need to be dispersed?



The right question hasn't been asked yet.

How to tell? One way is, you haven't met

The part of you that forgives and forgets.



As uncomfortable as today seems,

You're asleep. Continue to dream.

To wake up, just give completely.



There is what you believe you know,

Like sea foam atop the ocean below,

And then the depths to rather forgo.



There is the painting. Here is the frame.

The two could pass for one and the same.

But the latter is how the former remains.



Nervousness limits the field of perception.

Stay calm to streamline your attention and

Expand your field, to broaden and lengthen.



There is a better way that's possible -

Better than just navigating obstacles.

Remember you're beyond biological.



You are more than this present situation -

More than some experience and education.

You are a daily wellspring of regeneration.



If you don't make enough space, you obscure

Your own intentions to the point of detour.

Devote time to emptying yet feeling secure.



Fall in love with the person you are,

Not because you've endured this far:

Because you're a live shooting star.



Go resupply, if that's what you need.

Don't let that replenishment exceed

The amount that sustains your speed.



Respond in due time, not immediately.

It numbs thought, too much expediency.

Retreat and listen to nature obediently.



Always going to get, giving to receive

Is to live life as a glorified machine.

To live as a beam of light instead, be.



You know you're not done, so don't check.

Don't even poke your head up, not just yet.

For now, continue to create and to sweat.



If it's something you don't value, retreat

Back to the place you go to feel complete.

This is your pact of defiance, not defeat.



When outside information doesn't register

As friendly, but of a cheating competitor,

First send it out to your longtime editor.



Truth is brief. Lies take long.

Lies are brittle, truth strong.

One is night and one is dawn.



You're not quite there at the end,

You're at a turning point again -

You're due to meet a best friend.



You're facing the wrong direction

If awe is directed in any direction

Other than directly at introspection.



The art of talking to yourself lovingly

First requires thinking becomingly,

Then raising the bar constructively.



To greet great thoughts, be strong -

Not just briefly, but all day long -

Until the lesser ones are all gone.



Is the tired real, or just in your head?

Is it a mind dragging drear or dread?

Is it a mind tired from being overfed?



Before pouncing onto their opinions, stop,

Lest you leap short and subsequently drop;

Remain still, poised instead, to listen a lot.



The chances of things happening as they do

Is enough constant, uncanny, daily proof

That something greater is probably afoot.



You keep trying to figure this out,

Like a young hound using its snout:

Just wait for the fox to come out.



You keep trying to figure this out.

The answer is simple: Be devout,

To anyone, anything (no doubt).



You keep trying to figure this out. Why?

All you get when you approach with a try

Is another attempt: Become redefined.



Still trying to figure out your answer?

Why give the question another chance?

Ask a better question, one that's grand.



Whether it sounds too convenient,

Or too impossible an achievement,

Go within for the only treatment.



If you had time for that, you no longer do.

To welcome guests, you first make room.

Clear your mind with the heart's broom.



Idle pastimes that celebrate the fool

Are for the crowd, but not for you.

Everything spreads (a golden rule).



You have the power to immediately leap

Over the whole entire, incompatible heap

By deciding to become the goal you seek.



Getting out into nature will delight and awe,

But the wilderness within is wilder and raw,

While rewarding you with its untamed calm.



May you understand as little as possible of

Things for which you're not responsible as

You master your realm of what's solvable.



You're allowed to be denied,

You're not allowed to whine.

You're obligated to redefine.



As a law of morality and health,

Use no one - including yourself.

You are neither an axe nor an elf.



No one's actions should have much effect

On the most important plan you have left,

That being deepening self-care and respect.



Ignore the news - big and/or small.

If you need it, they'll tell you it all.

In the meantime, go heed your call.



You're journey a world of hearts, not ideas.

You lose if you crusade, win when you feel

Their life without their needing to appeal.



You're going to develop a new skill.

You may not want to, but you will.

You're a being of light - so, fulfill.



Living true means serving yourself first,

Then quenching the outer world's thirst.

When did this work for you in reverse?



Your big chance is in this moment,

To interrupt where habit flows in

And do as you have freshly chosen.



Your habits have held your life in a cycle,

Mostly for good, but certainly for a while.

Make a new choice, even if it's just a trial.



Physical habits are challenging enough,

Emotional ones can interfere with love.

Habits build more than you dream of.



Which habits are you most concerned with?

Which ones serve and which no longer fit?

Which habits just need a better friend mix?



Were you the one who made all these habits?

Or were some left here by an outside pattern?

Without their cause, which ones even matter?



Your best tools are getting sharper,

Better at cutting, better at carving.

With them, you're building larger.



You know not to rush, but the why

May elude you from time to time:

Rushing, to your heart, is unkind.



You know not to complain, but the why

Avoids this spotlight most of the time:

Put plainly, complaining ruts the mind.



No one can "give you your time back."

Whoever promises to is surely a quack;

Your energy is real, time is abstract.



Wherever you may travel on this earth,

Here you are - as you've been since birth.

Before you go, make sure you're here first.



Do what fits this moment, forget the rest.

Life is not a classroom. This is not a test.

For the moment's sake, you do your best.



Another friendly reminder here, bub:

No matter what you have or have done,

Being you is already more than enough.



If you had all at once, lived all your dreams

And were somehow right back here already,

Would that get you to surrender to peace?



If you don't already know,

There's nowhere new to go.

Inside you is the only show.



It's noble, laudable that you keep trying.

But you may miss what's still underlying:

Every one of us has to do our own smiling.



Long before you're known for a thing,

You must be delivering and delivering,

So keep asking what value you can bring.



Your answers always come,

Sounding steady, not abrupt,

But pause if you interrupt.



Life is everything, except fair.

Each has our blessings to bear.

Each has a challenge to share.



"Happy" is not one of today's guarantees.

But today does openly offer you peace

That outshines every mere happening.



Not every situation comes lined with joy,

But peace is woven into even what annoys.

Love is the only skill you have to deploy.



Life cannot lower itself to be fair.

Different amounts of differences to share

Means goodness awaits us everywhere.



Appreciate those inner masterpieces.

They flash across your mind daily,

Awaiting your attention patiently.



Like cooking days before the guests come,

Or never getting around to getting it done,

Preparation admits: By timing it's won.



Should you rush? Should you wait?

What if you're too early? Or late?

Do not leave your timing to fate.



When decides the whole thing -

If they welcome what you bring

Or not, as timing is everything.



There is no "astray,"

No block, no delay -

You are, underway.



Would you recognize the thing we call grace

Without its actual, everyday, literal name?

Are thinking on and living in it the same?



For as long as you need to question,

Answers will come for each intention:

Are you ready for the next dimension?



When you embrace what already is, 

You'll begin to completely exist -

And be beyond changing any of it.



If you can buy it, it's false -

Or at least a part, and not all.

What comes through, not across?



Truth does not come in installments,

Nor does it revise itself very often.

What's true is true, every dawn.



What have you been wondering about most?

Would a simple answer keep you engrossed?

What if you invited your mind to coast?



The reasons you have are incomplete,

But do not bother with tidy and neat:

Do the feelings feel solid? Concrete?



If your most fulfilling day

Had its own presence gauge,

Every next day would change.



With whom can you simply sit

And just as simply just be quiet?

What should you do with this?



If that is this good for you, continue.

Imagine what else will improve if you

Strengthen all your spiritual sinews.



Do you want to yawn, yell, or yield?

Pay more attention to how you feel.

More than ingredients make a meal.



The circumstances aren't real;

They can only reflect or reveal

Whatever you've chosen to feel.



Until you surrender to deep change,

In the same situation you'll remain.

Offer up everything you are today.



The years will pass regardless of intent,

So may as well choose how you'll bless -

While being stationary or transcendent.



You can stay this way and still do good,

Or venture far beyond where you would,

Daring to love (whether misunderstood).



As for "powers beyond comprehension,"

Pay to them all of exactly no attention.

Focus your energy on this dimension.



Point your day toward the light.

Move only toward peace, despite.

The very best from others, invite.



Treat every single day as supernatural

And though critics call you irrational,

You'll feel so supported, unflappable.



Without knowing what they put into that,

Don't try to fit it in your day's backpack.

You'd be wise to go without or backtrack.



You don't know what you don't know,

So don't go at all, or else make it slow.

Mystery above can mean chaos below.



Celebrate about things that make good sense,

About goodness with a reach that's immense,

About greatness that's insightful, not intense.



Go ahead, you can do it if you still want to.

Is it something your mind still responds to?

Is it something being still is a response to?



Mourn what you feel you've lost,

But understand this was the cost

(Be grateful your paths crossed).



If self-preservation is the target,

You'll wind up back in the market:

Deeper giving is the goal incarnate.



If you're naming some heroes, some villains,

Distinguishing a few soldiers, many civilians,

You're putting them all under paper pavilions.



You're at this point because you're ready.

Whether or not you can hold things steady,

You have exactly what will be necessary.



Break your goal into smaller chunks,

Lest your mind sabotage or debunk.

You will get immediately unstuck.



That sense of overwhelm decreases

By dividing it into smaller pieces

Let "Simplify" be today's thesis.



If they're confused again, scale it back.

Find where simplicity begins to crack

And unburden it with a smaller stack.



To be a more effective fit,

Chop it up into tinier bits,

Into targets you can hit.



Your workload has gotten out of hand.

You'll have difficulty, until you plan.

A calculated approach equals grand.



The act of letting them know they matter

Sits opposite of flattery and idle chatter,

And helps them write their next chapter.



Do you understand the entire scope?

Be honest. If the answer is, "Nope,"

Into your scheduled priorities probe.



Are you working on a vision or a project?

A project is something with end dates set.

A vision is what your momentum reflects.



You're too focused on the how

And what its limits will allow;

Focusing on why grows the now.



You motivate people with your energy,

And that is why what is most necessary

Is to be interested in others' journeys.



Do you need other people to get this done?

Are there better steps to the best outcome?

Who can help who considers this part fun?



Do the thing that so many wouldn't.

Do the thing that you once couldn't.

Do the thing some say you shouldn't.



Wondering whether to go that new road,

Or dig in here and unpack your payload?

Whatever you do, don't do as you're told.



Life tends to change

On no particular day:

To prepare, sway.



It will happen just as it's meant to.

You're already ready by being you,

And letting your thoughts be few.



First find out what you have in common,

Then ask your intuition for its cautions.

Finally, agree to more trusted talking.



You need this part to end so you can begin

The part without results that lose or win,

The part that has you daily diving within.



What is yours and what is theirs?

Commiserating doesn't show you care.

From what's very best in you, share.



Your mind is wonderful at what it does,

But asking it for advice on love is like

Seeking food insights from your lungs.



An invitation to focus on fears

Is one you can invite to disappear.

In this, be firmly, fiercely sincere.



Without even the slightest command,

Whatever you discuss begins to expand.

Share what you want more of, firsthand.



Even from things that leave us shaken,

We eventually and completely awaken,

Aware of what must be fully forsaken.



Leave fear just where it is - you move.

Take it's nudge to go somewhere new.

The only one of you two who can is you.



Today will be filled up with invitations

To go left, right, or round in rotations.

Thank each. Continue on your own way.



Not all things lost need be found.

It's not enough that it's profound;

Ask your own heart how it sounds.



Simple is much more than it seems:

Simple holds health against disease,

Simple masters complexity and ease.



Ease is anything but passive.

Ease endures the combative.

Ease's love is truly massive.



It is time for you to awaken.

Sleep must now be forsaken.

Rise ready... and unshaken.



Set aside what you do prefer.

Get out from where you were.

It has nothing new to confer.



The things you usually prefer,

What do they cause to occur?

Does the pot need a big stir?



Get up, and out, and into it.

Air to breathe, fields to till,

Your fire is, as of now, lit.



You don't need an approval to begin.

It doesn't matter if they let you in.

The moment you show up, you win.



Congratulations, from here you go up.

You give it your all, you rest enough,

And you introduce everyone to love.



Pre-dawn, you simply trust

Light is coming - it must.

All you can do now is just...



What will you do while the day is here?

Have you planned it out? Is it all clear?

What remains once the hours disappear?



What will you ask today to leave behind?

Will you hold this in your heart or mind?

How will you return the favor? Be kind.



There are a certain number of hours coming

In which you can effectively do something,

But not every bit of it needs to be running.



Compromise until you won't,

Do it poorly until you don't:

Life is to be lived, not told.



Not only does inspiration ask for your time,

It asks you to prepare a certain peace of mind

Of which there is only one inspirable kind.



When you drink from inspiration's well,

Your heart and soul may begin to swell,

As ideas from beyond you begin to tell...



Inspiration does not come cheap.

It costs all you cast on the heap -

Everything related to normalcy.



Mediocrity is worse than you realize.

Beyond being self-hatred in disguise,

It prevents one from becoming wise.



Wherever you are encouraged to settle,

Is where mediocrity's minions meddle.

Move for moving's sake. Be your rebel.



Are you the one expected to apologize?

Again? Are you yet starting to realize

Exactly what this is, poorly disguised?



The sooner you deepen loving yourself,

The sooner you will hear no one else's

Opinion on what you need to be well.



If you love time alone,

Then welcome home.

If not, then go roam.



Inspiration might slip right past

Unless you put everything else last.

You will get it all, if you don't grasp.



Inspiration won't knock. Keep a door open.

It swooshes through the room you've chosen,

Usually leaving an antique status quo broken.



Inspiration is as important as it gets,

For fire it sparks and the tone it sets.

Notice, it leaves behind it no regrets.



Inspiration doesn't wish for you to wait.

It's not sure if it's running early or late,

But said to say it's definitely on its way.



What to do, while awaiting your inspiration?

Why be irrational, irresponsible, impatient?

Why not get yourself into a flow of creation? 



That's enough about what you don't want.

Declare a ceasefire - a period of detente -

As you imagine improving very best part.



You're already halfway there!

Yes, it's been an uphill affair,

Yet you are beyond compare.



Where is your wellspring of inspiration?

Where do you go to feel easeful elation?

How often does it send you an invitation?



Engaging in processes you know don't work

Is a way of engaging in the process of hurt.

Engage instead in your preexisting worth.



Focus helps you hurdle obstacles faster.

Focus snatches up anything you're after.

Focus becomes your schedule's master.



Inspiration asks you to sacrifice

To bring what it whispers to life.

So, offer it all you feel inside.



This is not a time to be abstract:

It's time to be specific to attract

Things that are tangibly exact.



What you're seeking is seeking you.

What it's looking for is your truth,

What it is you're specifically up to.



Let them clump up and move as a herd.

For you that would be more than absurd.

Solitude is where answers are conferred.



Know what you want before they offer,

Not so that you can negotiate or barter,

But in order for you to remain softened.



It has to be on your terms this time,

Mostly because you know what's right,

But also because of your key insights.



If there's nothing to say, don't speak,

Since words pour out like wet concrete,

And harden when they're not discreet.



Yes, your circle defines you.

Make sure they align with you.

Is what they do fine with you?



It is understandable - to be annoyed -

But don't let composure be destroyed.

What you know will be too much, avoid.



You are not just one thing, you're many,

Which you most likely well know already.

But give yourself some leeway, or plenty.



You are a being with abilities dynamic -

From the power to hurry but not panic,

To the ability to perceive in panoramic.



Appreciation will remain worthwhile

Throughout your whole, entire lifetime.

Come what may, you'll be versatile.



The ability to envision what isn't there

Doesn't take rare genius or savoir faire,

It calls for your being open and aware.



Change is your friend.

It has advice to lend,

And rules to bend.



Sheer inspiration can direct you.

Step in front of it, you will lose.

Stay behind it and enjoy the view.



Let inspiration call you forth.

Let it be your compass north.

Let it move things forward.



You celebrate the completion of a plan,

Like the music of collaboration's band.

But you are awed by inspiration's hand.



Unless you feel like you're just playing,

It's not somewhere you should be staying.

When you improvise, you feel amazing.



Are you able to experiment with it?

To have no idea where to go with it?

To end up feeling wonder infinite?



The most amazing part of life is that space

Between solid certainty and heavenly grace

Where you can lose yourself without a trace.



If you ever lose all sense of time and space

When doing the thing you love to do all day,

You've created heaven on earth the easy way.



"Plan" and "play" share all but one letter.

That one letter makes one all the better.

Let your inner child snub your go-getter.



Doing, without a sense of play, is work.

Working, without enjoying the day, can hurt.

Living, with levity and laughter comes first.



Even on its worst day,

Play is still just play,

And thus, the best way.



When playing, you're unconcerned

You're oblivious, and unburdened.

By carefree you, you're reaffirmed.



Do it in a way that feels light,

That sweeps you up just right,

That puts you to sleep at night.



When you're summoned, pause.

Do you know why you were called?

Take your time, but do not stall.



Move consciously, or you will get hurt.

This is not an argument for safety first,

It is a reminder of what you are worth.



Stretch to the bounds of your limits,

In body, in mind, but not in minutes.

Pay nature thanks in hours of visits.



It is people who do the damage

When they let big ideas manage.

Your humanity is your advantage.



Be selective with sharing your backstory.

Whether they use it to feel pity or glory,

Your time is too valuable for inventory.



This is a vow to hereby honor my time,

To rescind it where its value declines,

To share it with whom my life aligns.



There are two lifelong things to remember:

No matter what, operate from your center,

And where you get to sacrifice, surrender.



One way through is smaller than the rest.

It is a door with a bit of mysteriousness

Where you will have your best time yet.



Doors that lead to somewhere indoors,

Won't be interesting to you anymore,

Once you discover your inner outdoors.



If it's not a vast expanse, it's a tiny yard.

You've done small plenty, come too far

To head anywhere but among the stars.



On you go, into your unknown -

On you go, feeling timid or bold.

On you go, because... you know.



Open this door, the one nearest and oddest.

Open this door, neither ornate nor modest.

Open this door, leading to an inner forest.



Once you go forward, you cannot come back.

The going will change you, what you attract,

And will take away your very concept of lack.



The door you choose makes all the difference.

Most doors lead to escape or deliverance;

One door leads you to your magnificence.



The doors that lead out to places that dazzle,

Lead farther out, to where you'll get frazzled;

The door going inward won't let you dabble.



You can do this, because you have a feeling

That most ways have too limited a meaning,

And you want what's forever, yet fleeting.



You're supposed to just keep going,

Not measuring, discussing, showing.

On this particular day, be growing.



Here is your cue - that's enough.

For now, you've filled your cup.

For now, it's no more new stuff.



What you take in, you must also let out,

Otherwise you'll grow a tail and a snout.

Embrace what detachment is all about.



More breathtaking than any landscape,

There are vistas in your inner space

That would lay mere art to waste.



Time to offer up, surrender, leave behind,

To cross the threshold of today's sublime

The things you've long declared, "Mine."



What are you ready to give up to enter?

What is no longer part of your center?

How will you know it's surrendered?



The crossover from here to your beyond

Is so short and yet will take just as long

As it takes you to embody a deeper calm.



The adventures that await will

Introduce something greater

Than you could ever dictate.



Your next mentor will be less formal,

Less seriously structured, less normal,

The next in a line of living portals.



You must leave so you can come back.

You have to regroup so you can relax.

You have to amass so you can attract.



Gather up and repair all your tools,

Even those few you'll unlikely use.

Only the unprepared end up fooled.



They're suffering too much to focus on you,

So don't keep focusing on how they're rude.

They benefit from your lovingkindness too.



Though it seemed a targeted rude,

They were not thinking about you.

It is you who now gets to choose.



Thinking is something they rarely do,

So what you then interpret to be rude

Is actually a simple, automated mood.



There's this one thing to comprehend

About times you're at your wit's end:

For some, it's harder to feel than offend.



For some, offense is easier than defense.

You meet them, and you'll know when.

You'll note not to take that way again.



There are very few "to look out for."

Best to think of it like a creaky door:

The hinges haven't been oiled before.



Don't spend much time on it, but do know

There are those who in darkness do sow

Things that only at night do grow.



If there is light to see, get out there.

The gift of wakefulness, dimly rare.

At first dawn, be ready to first share.



Catch your mood if it starts to turn down.

Search for the cause, listen for its sound.

Bring your intuition's ear to the ground.



Everything has a story to it.

Explore yourself through it,

Except if the self outgrew it.



Whether or not you yourself think it ought,

Everything that exists exists as a thought, so

Fixate your mind on goodness all day long.



You will continue to get better at this

If you continue to focus on the best fit

In how each person and every part mix.



They'll hold you back if you'll allow.

They'll support if you tell them how.

They've always been here for you now.



As you come in through today's door,

Take your grand invitation to explore,

Enjoy, create, and create some more.



The sparkling things will briefly delight,

But where you will marvel at how bright

Is where, without a word, there's insight.



Yes, you still have more left to know,

The world has yet more left to show,

But you have no more left to undergo.



This is the place where one path ends,

Where you bid farewell to old friends,

And you find where a new road begins.



Are you ready to bid them farewell?

You'll return with such tales to tell

If you first emerge from that shell.



There is only so much you should take

Before you ever so clearly shall state

They are not welcome in this space.



You have no way of knowing what they do

When they're in their world without you.

But when with you, how do they choose?



You can only control your standards,

And when unmet, how you'll handle

Things to achieve something ample.



If you'd been more easily offended,

How much worse it might've ended.

It's always about your perspective.



You get to say, "That's enough,"

If they're too rude or too rough.

You get to say their time is up.



Sustaining that sense of wonder,

Just keeping it from going under

Requires you to be a bit blunter.



Is this a new chapter, or a new book?

Based on the trek you last undertook,

Does this feel like a new kind of good?



Sometimes you need to be stern.

Some need the rules to be firm.

Some only see when fire burns.



Create based on all you feel,

Not based on what is "real."

You are your work's appeal.



You need to meet face to face,

Not just in this specific case.

Try to make it commonplace.



While clever outsmarts itself,

Shrewd empties its own shelf,

But health makes itself well.



As you get closer, it feels much farther.

Nearing a bend, the journey gets harder.

But be grateful you made the departure.



Be grateful for the blessing of being you,

Beyond the trials you've braved through,

Be grateful this much love gets to be you.



You're already complete, others just help

With your daily maintenance of this self.

Make sure they all know their jobs well.



The way you balance effort and ease

Is a delightful show of your expertise

In living intentionally as you please.



You ask for help when you need it.

You ask for space when you mean it.

You ask for quiet when you feel it.



Do you feel like you're a reservoir?

Or more like a grand, exotic bazaar?

Only you know who you really are.



Give yourself the permission to feel good.

Encourage yourself to do what you should.

You deserve to feel inspired and reassured.



Affirming and encouraging someone

Is a lifetime good deed you've done,

Which, in turn, can affect everyone.



Rather than react

Where you are at,

In this case, adapt.



Doing the work that works for you

Will absolutely carry you through

Any storm that the day can brew.



What can those circumstances decide

If they can't reach you here inside?

It's flattering that they even tried.



Are you living by all you believe?

Can you count the inconsistencies

Yet show yourself abiding mercy?



You spent the day engaged in talks.

To call this a waste would be false:

You let them feel their thoughts.



Which part of this going to matter,

- not next week or year - long after?

This is your decision's main factor.



The little things are what matter,

How they feel with you, and after.

Little things are a positive pattern.



What would it feel like, really?

Would it involve a committee?

To live your dream, completely?



Today's misfortune is tomorrow's blessing,

For all the lukewarm friends it's detecting.

A housecleaning, of any sort, is refreshing.



If there's a timeline attached,

That's not where true joy is at.

Happiness has nothing to catch.



Joy is here even when happiness fades,

Because joy comes from what remains -

Knowing how life felt when you gave.



The little things are all that matter:

How you felt before, during, after,

And how generous was the laughter.



Rest will come. You will restore

To a deeper degree than before...

Because this time you gave more.



Almost there, isn't a goal.

You pitched, but what sold?

Over results, take control.



You are what you do repeatedly do.

Your habits more than reflect you,

Your habits are the real daily you.



Little by little makes the sweetest way

Because it takes time to wander, stray,

And yet still check in with yesterday.



You get to keep going, out past the limits,

Beyond the noisy marketplace's gimmicks

To where your authenticity comes to visit.



You get to keep going, to not write back.

You get to go get lost and veer off track. 

You get to let nonsense pile up a stack.



It's alright that you spoke too much.

Sometime soon, you'll make it all up

To them by listening, and with love.



Breathing takes care of itself,

As goes for most of your health.

All that's left is to think well.



There's a place close by, beseeching,

A place you can't get to by reaching,

An infinite place once you're being.



Years to trek the whole planet, wide and far,

Or one moment from here to the farthest star:

Thought is for traveling right where you are.



Once it's spoken, it is vulnerable

To the words of the insufferable.

What you utter is irrecoverable.



The future is here as a little seed,

Whispering to you its little needs.

Its littleness ends when it feeds.



Time passes differently for what you desire.

It bends, unfolds, envelops you for awhile -

Hours in minutes, a moment in a lifetime.



Surrender to the state you crave,

Be calmly open, serenely brave.

You become by how you behave.



Air goes in your lungs,

Food goes into the gut,

Where's money hung?



What is the use of even a little more power?

To make a more effective use of one's hour?

Answer after imagining a beautiful flower.



Some folks are a reflection, others a smudge.

Use some to change, for others, don't budge.

The difference is often just slight enough.



If they feed their ears a garbage stew,

And extend a dinner invitation to you,

The disease-free answer is, to refuse.



Choice is your greatest power, not will.

Choosing is how your world gets built.

Choosing brings you every other skill.



If they feast their eyes on unsightly stew,

What healthy insights can they offer you?

Become more aware of what feeds whom.



There's such a thing as spiritual sugar too,

An empty boost of energy that leaves soon.

Spiritual nourishment: behold the moon.



We have emotional sugar, fat, and salt that

Do the same as their culinary counterparts.

Too much of any on your plate, scrape off.



There is a sort of sugar for the mind -

Of the busy bee / tail-chasing dog kind

(ideas with too much filling inside).



They're not irksome to bring you stress.

They remind: the best revenge is success.

Therefore, hone yourself, but care less.



Enough talk about what you don't want,

What if that list just found itself forgot,

And in a beam of beauty, you got caught?



Wealth is relationships, not trinkets.

A one-sided embrace with gold ingots

Cannot touch the warmth love brings us.



Keep your mind focused on the best

States of being you can imagine yet.

Naturally, that is what you will get.



There is a tight corner coming here, a turn.

While the sharpness need be of less concern,

It's the conditions you'll need to discern.



Prepare for this day, but also be open

To whatever it's preparing to show you.

Your life holds more than all you've chosen.



Be ready to meet a new part of yourself,

One that was waiting for you to be well

Enough to share the story it has to tell.



Embrace your sense of wonder,

That sees beyond the numbers,

And grows you ever younger.



You have no idea how much others need you,

Barely ever for what your branches produce,

Always to lean on the strength of your roots.



Standards are to be held high

As your own personal guide

For daily wrong versus right.



You are so beautiful, you might not see.

You move through life this gracefully,

Receiving all your gifts so patiently.



You have a beauty far deeper than the skin.

A living gift to whichever place you're in,

Your being changes how everyone has been.



Thank you for being this way -

Present, but not on display -

Serene, but ready to convey.



You are so beautiful, still or in motion,

Because of a message in you, unspoken:

You and love are uniquely interwoven.



Do what works, or do what fits -

That's what this crossroads is.

Your decision decides the trip.



You are so beautiful - truer than fact -

Made of aspects that divinely interact,

A body, mind, heart, soul - all intact.



The beauty all around is within you.

The loveliest one has always been you.

Sinking in? If not, may it begin to.



Appreciate your beauty, as it is today.

Appreciation is enlightenment's way

Of reminding you you can rise yet stay.



From a place of peace, all is possible.

Peaceful waters make a river crossable.

A peaceful heart makes life phenomenal.



Peace has no deliverables or requirements,

But it may surprise gift you an alignment

Between feeling relaxation and excitement.



You'll have ever deeper states of peace

That will start with a convenient ease

Up through steadiness in stormy seas.



In service, some days will be rough.

It will feel more sensible to give up,

But peace will grant energy enough.



Whether you feel at odds or alone,

Let a sense of peace guide you home

Because of what you've always known.



When peace descends, you'll know it -

From your head down to your toes, it

Is yours though you can't control it.



Peace won't try to make sense of that -

It will simply embrace where you're at

And silence all the cataloging of facts.



With peace, you'll no longer need to beware:

You'll have all you need after giving bare.

The more you have, the more you'll share.



You can have peace just like anything else,

By earnestly willing it straight to yourself.

If it's from above or beyond, just as well.



Are you coming at this as a whole?

Or as a body/mind without a soul?

Be as welcoming as an empty bowl.



From the part of you that has labels,

To the parts which are least enabled,

Your whole self belongs at the table.



All of you is what makes the best choice.

In this, give your entire being a voice,

So the complete you feels overjoyed.



All your experiences are valid and of use

As your mind searches your past for clues.

Treat them all lightly, and as partly true.



Everything in you points toward truth -

Right down to your little quirks, too.

Just follow any all the way through.



Are you fully here? Have you brought all?

Are you willing, regardless of what befalls?

Are you ready to answer today's inner call?



All that's asked of you today is, everything.

What you are invited to, called upon, to bring

Is nothing short of a life's worth of offering.



Bringing your all, doesn't include dumping

Any stories, dramas, burdens upon anybody.

Today, your all includes a silent something.



Everything. You are invited to share

Every reason that causes you to care,

Everything that makes you this rare.



Your all - you're able to give it,

Because today you already live it

By challenging just one more limit.



How you frame it will decide your health.

Just as your attitude can make you well,

How you frame surprises has lots to tell.



No one has any of the reasons you suspect.

Many are so tangled in their own inner net,

That they could use your blind forgiveness.



Love naturally gives the whole basket,

Considers no labor of love a work task,

And will do more if you just ask it.



To what some call a silly notion,

You possess an undying devotion,

Because you sense a larger ocean.



The time for measuring has passed.

You're on the brink at long last.

All remaining doubts, be trashed.



Embark into this whole new realm,

Bravely gripping your inner helm,

Brazenly shouting, "All is well!"



You are in control of more than you know.

You get to say how every conversation goes.

You get the power of yes, the shield of no.



It's finally time to be done with pretense,

To realize that you need no more defense:

You have entered into this best you yet.



You used to have complicated theses

To explain each of these life pieces.

But now you know, life has no creases.



Smooth out your own rough spots.

There is a way to reach the top:

It involves not talking a lot.



The summit is here, or very close.

You've done the work, at least most.

Now enjoy, not having a flag to post.



Near the peak, avoid all who boast.

Because at this altitude, or almost,

An avalanche awaits many of those.



As you reach the top, welcome awe.

Greater than anything you ever saw,

Is light without the weight of law.



Here at the summit, you're now being reached

By the very same feeling you once beseeched:

The very act of climbing is the way you teach.



If you focus on those below,

Those above may never know

Who to help off the plateau.



Sometimes you go deeper, others higher.

Each needs something different to inspire,

Different wood for hotter/brighter fire.



They don't need to accept your approach,

Even though they will benefit the most

Learning from your degree of thorough.



Yes indeed, there are that many ways

To think about and go about today's

Weather, waiting out any brief haze.



This is the gift you have been bestowed -

A whole entire day, a 24-hour payload of

Kismet, grace and a touch of unknown.



May you be blessed with the riches of truth,

The treasure trove of lessons old and new,

And a fine vessel to hold them all: you.



May you forget all you ever had to bear,

But cherish every moment you got to care,

Moving forward, clean and clear and bare.



How it works? May you never fully know.

May you remain as children loving snow.

May you in wonder, not memories, grow.



This is what the top sort of looks like.

Hopefully you enjoyed most of the hike.

Stay long enough for the starry night.



You've reached the center of this place -

The clearing that's been emanating grace.

For at least a while longer, you should stay.



When you know, you'll take action.

Until then, take some satisfaction:

Hard parts only take up a fraction.



Be still now, you've done enough.

Be still, to receive and feel a love

That bows to you for looking up.



Trust yourself to think just enough.

Trust yourself to perseveringly love.

Trust yourself to make this true fun.



To know what must be done yet not do it

Has a nearly endearing childishness to it:

Nonetheless, today you break through it.



A harder stone or flowing water both grind

A jagged rock down into a smooth sublime:

Bring either the right tool or enough time.



Consider all of this from another angle,

One that doesn't start another wrangle:

Consider this invitation to disentangle.



There is one message Focus wishes to tell:

Doing too many things is doing none well.

Today is where your Doing should dwell.



Become thorough yet swift in self-repair,

Lest you spend all your time on self-care;

A whole wide world awaits you out there.



The only one you make happy is yourself.

But choosing to do so then spreads wealth,

The truth that self-appreciation is health.



Wisdom is very different from information.

One is built by piling up higher education

One is built by breaking through limitations.



How you think about anything is everything,

So regardless of what it is you're considering,

Consider the thoughts most worth mirroring.



Here is your most reliable, lifelong test

To tell if this current thinking is best:

The feeling it breathes into your chest.



Whatever feels deeply worthwhile

Asks for a deeper use of your time:

Deeply seek and you'll deeply find.



When you're feeling, being, and allowing,

You do away with all undue kowtowing,

And begin gently, genuinely disavowing.



Before the planting comes the plowing,

So clear a path for goodness' endowing:

Begin by being, feeling, and allowing.



Allow yourself to feel all that you feel

To notice what being yourself reveals

(It proves you have the power to heal).



Right here is where to do it from.

As for changes, you've made enough.

Right here, come do what you love.



Don't wish for problems to go away:

Find a pattern. Close attention pay.

Understand what makes some sway.



As yesterday is farther away than the moon,

Even tomorrow is forever out of reach too.

Now's the only time you can arrive at You.



There's no compromise for you to enter.

It only works when you're at the center,

In the leadership role of this adventure.



Time to stop saying, "Well, at least..."

Since your potential has been unleashed,

The cost of wasting time just increased.



Your time grows more valuable by the day,

So more obligations will have to give way

To clear space for what won't be delayed.



So you've had yet another "breakthrough."

How many does it take to finally free you?

How about wall-building be discontinued?



Patterns recur, yet wearing different faces.

Realizing this quicker each time embraces

The fact that thoughts leave human traces.



It isn't in the length of your talks,

Nor is it the distance of your walk,

It's in the clarity of your thoughts.



The people needed to guide you on through

From preparation's nest to untold skies blue,

You don't know them: But your friends do.



When feeling grateful for all the "good,"

Give the "bad" all the thanks you should.

It's taught more than school ever could.



When your friends can't help, you can.

What they don't have that you demand,

Is your next level up of helping hands.



Despite all you've ever done to help,

You can do far more for someone else

By doing it more deeply for yourself.



Perspective turns every supposed plight

Immediately into a challenging delight:

Oh, how a mess can awaken your insight!



Treat blaming like a late, or faulty alarm.

Fix your own response to signals of harm:

Next time, defend yourself, don't disarm.



Unless and until it comes from you,

It is merely information, not truth.

Always, always go your own route.



Beware of too much pampering.

Comfort has a way of hampering

Your big questions' answering.



You assume you're tired, but it's not true,

Because you're tireless when you pursue

What is most deeply meaningful to you.



Even once you've gotten all the right tools,

They must be organized (maintained, too)

For them to readily (reliably) support you.



Don't portray things worse than they are,

And don't exaggerate them up to the stars:

An honest end comes from an honest start.



Whether you take this to be high or low,

There is something you need to know:

This is not where you are to stay. Go.



Live neither casually agreeing,

Nor unconsciously fleeing.

Do things as a way of being.



Self-care isn't when others dote on you,

Nor is it when your past is on review:

It's when your time is spent on truth.



Stop measuring what you did last.

"Progress" bases itself on the past.

It's the present. Enjoy. Detach.



Your standards matter.

They're like a ladder,

Taking you up faster.



All you've been through,

This, has always been true:

You know what to do.



This is not something you can be shown.

It's more like a muscle you must grow

With a routine that is all your own.



Even those who don't seem to uplift

Are offering you one beautiful gift

By showing a life without the shift.



If repetition makes things clearer.

And habits draw their result nearer,

Today is tomorrow's magic mirror.



Don't do that anymore.

Its foundation is unsure.

Find the thing you adore.



You've been shown all you need to know.

Let any attachment to the outcome... go.

First, be decisive. Right after that, flow.



What you pay attention to always grows,

Even if it's a thing you're still telling no:

What you immediately ignore, you forgo.



Take suggestions, but not quickly to heart

If outside you is where they got their start.

Coming from you is the most important part.



You are fantastic and beautiful all at once.

To your inner critic, you must be blunt.

The mind's mumblers - go and confront.



Over the years, the things you've craved,

Have they all been the same, unchanged?

Meet different needs. It's a different day.



Believing you'll get there is not enough,

Nor will work alone get this thing done:

Above (and beneath) it all must be love.



What if those thoughts don't even fit?

Which target are they aiming to hit?

Expanded awareness will never miss.



A poorly-made product isn't to blame.

With conversations, too, it's the same:

How you make choices must change.



Sometimes you feel long overdue,

And thus begin to soundly overdo.

Know, you have power over you.



Just because this is your newest,

That doesn't make it your truest,

Nor do you even have to pursue it.



There is wisdom, and there is youth:

One has the energy to plow through -

The other, powers patient pursuit.



Are you taking responsibility for yourself?

Or are you instead blaming someone else?

To be honest and accountable is to be well.



Judgment ends communication,

So give more accommodation by

Practicing a fierce appreciation.



No matter how believable that is,

Only this is ever and always true -

How it feels gets decided by you.



Goodness comes before greatness appears.

Good does great without fanfare or cheers.

Good habits today, great results for years.



Everyone is responsible for their load.

You are to carry none but your own -

You are to bring no one else's home.



You have inherited a number of years

To have more than a fulfilling career:

Use your time to live a life that's clear.



Who you're becoming is more mature -

More able to perceive, foresee, endure.

Today is making your patience... pure.



This place supports your growth,

Until you outgrow what it holds.

To expand inward, you must go.



You are the only one who can know that -

The only one who decides what impact

Things will have on you, so detach.



To throw that away is not to waste it,

But to declare that rather than taste it,

This will be your new way to face it.



Know that everyone has something for you.

Whenever you believe this to be least true

Is exactly when life has the most proof.



Arriving late to anger will serve you best,

Because if that reaction is indeed wisest,

Every other option was first put to rest.



Their rant is a noisy substitute,

Not to be listened or catered to.

What you truly need is solitude.



That conversation in which

Your whole self isn't a fit

Doesn't deserve you in it.



Anger is a tool, but one that wrecks -

Useful when things need a hard reset,

Useless once there are no things left.



Seek out the beauty all around you.

Let this be a lifelong daily pursuit

(The seeker is the source - it's true).



It's a myth - that "too late."

You simply have to wait for

Goodness to welcome grace.



There's plenty of learning left to do,

But you must feel your way through,

Focusing where your heart says to.



Don't make your point so vague

That it's an empty theater stage.

Being specific makes you brave.



The benefit to doing it that way so long

Is you know the best way to do it wrong;

The mistakes make your mastery strong.



It's to make your own perspective wider

(Not for the mere sake of going higher),

Why you must step into being a climber.



Self-critique for what you "should've known"

Is a frame of mind that you "should" disown;

Thank Past-You for the patience it has shown.



Not needing anyone to "tell" you the truth,

Everyone is living it right in front of you.

Your intuition is all you "need" for proof.



Do for yourself, share with the group.

The proper ratio? Totally up to you.

If at all possible, combine the two.



The way you thought no longer fits,

Or else it won't be "when," but "if."

Enough of all your thinking! Begin.



This is not to say you're doing too much,

But to ask if you'd recognize "enough?"

(Don't go too easy, don't be too rough.)



No matter who in the world adores you,

No one else can celebrate this for you -

What would honor your good fortune?



You'll never know exactly Where this goes.

When you'll get there? Who even knows?

What and How are all you always control.



You have always been the one who beholds.

Now be the one who ventures out, who goes

Where you have no option but to be bold.



Strengths reward, but weaknesses remind

Of what's left to accomplish deep inside.

Give each some, but none all, of your time.



Learning well from yesterday's sorrow,

Always seek to give, but rarely borrow:

This is how to plan your best tomorrow.



Bound for the sun, but stopping at the moon

Is the risk you run by celebrating too soon.

If you wait, there awaits a far greater boon.



Without worrying about what comes next,

Can you set aside the heap in your head to

Point and laugh at "what makes sense?"



With no plan, comes no decision.

A poor plan rewards via revision.

A good plan grants grand wishes.



Patiently plan a way that works for you -

One brimming with what you love to do,

And topped with a daily dose of solitude.



What if you wholly embraced you at your best?

What if you planned for unbelievable success?

What, if you did, would naturally come next?



No one else holds the authority

To give your choices seniority:

You must be your first priority.



Whether it makes you celebrate or retreat,

Experience is limited - and yet complete:

It's how you feel that's the takeaway treat.



This choice is a link in a chain of events.

So while it may be neither start nor end,

It is your best self's most invaluable friend.



Success attracts attention all the more,

So beware. Who's now moving toward?

Protect what you've worked hardest for.



Understand that's it's been you all along -

The only one you could ever make strong,

The only one in whose approval you belong.



As you raise your standards, life improves

As much from what you think to say and do

As from the new people and places you choose.



Our habits don't really care who we are,

Yet they pick where we go, and how far.

Adopt habits that help, and do no harm.



Set aside all the history you've amassed -

There's nothing awaiting you in the past.

Your untethered present is, unsurpassed.



That goal was more like mental clothing:

You wore it until you started outgrowing 

That life of telling rather than knowing.



Change your approach - this time, surrender.

Forget the things you've always remembered.

Let not-knowing be what you most treasure.



Think about what you're thinking about most:

Is this the kind of thinking you should host?

Think about what better thinking promotes.



No shortcuts, no temporaries, no tricks.

When you have to, stop everything to fix

The things that make up your whole mix.



Since you're stronger than you realize,

You can toss that weakness mask aside

And reveal a power you've held inside.



Beware, or backwards you might go.

What is behind you, do not follow.

Face forward and find today's flow.



Working hard without proper standards

Is like a boiling pot without handles -

Put limits on all incoming channels.



Decline their offers, turn down each dare

To glance at challenges rather than stare.

Little by little is how you get anywhere.



When you stop mislabeling procrastination,

Then you can start the loving investigation

Into what your body is stubbornly stating.



Wherever your delivery feels to be lagging,

Wherever your momentum keeps dragging,

What voice inside you is actually nagging?



Trust each delay more than you already do.

Notice how each one has nothing to prove,

Accomplishing without pushing through.



Wherever you're not as good as you will be,

You must develop a little more competency

So you can think a lot more independently.



Who is coming is a friend you haven't met

Because of things you haven't done yet, so

Dare your current efforts to fully stretch.



You know some things the rest of us do not.

So make this a must rather than an ought -

Act like time is the only wealth you've got.



Fourteen-hundred and forty are all you get

To work, play, eat, cleanse and to fully rest.

Make every minute a deposit, and not a bet.



Overextending starts innocently enough,

Under the pretense of kindness and love,

But view your overextending from above.



What you complain about as your problems

Are inviting you to, one by one, solve them

For you and others yet waiting to blossom.



Forget about tasks that feel petty,

And issues you've settled already.

Tackle what matters. Get sweaty.



We all need you doing exactly as you choose

Because for each of us it unlocks more truth

Of how we want to be, and ultimately, who.



Today is your life recipe's freshest ingredient -

Some must be bought, others can only be lent;

Do you have enough stuff to start cooking yet?




Time is one thing - effort is another.

One sudden spark is easily smothered,

A steady smolder burns undiscovered.



It might not be easy, but it will be clear.

You won't have to be anything but sincere

As you tell them that cannot remain here.



What irks you serves a far greater purpose

Than to make you focus on what's worse:

It's here to get you to focus on you first.



Before uttering even two self-righteous words,

Beware that one of them may even seem absurd

Because your greater purpose here is to serve.



You also learn who you are by who you're not,

So in the net of obligations, don't get caught.

Be free enough to do what you feel you ought.



You've built according to your passions,

Now build upon your successful actions

To live in simple, spacious satisfaction.



You're right to feel unduly rushed,

But keep your protestations hushed

While finding who you truly trust.



Nothing is worth getting so riled.

Nothing lasts longer than a while,

So do nothing without some style.



Even if it first feels selfish or absurd,

Gather up for yourself some reserves -

Your own private reminder of worth.



Half-measures aren't an option for you;

Find a way to see it all the way through

No matter the approach you have to use.



Restlessness is no excuse to settle.

Impatience is no excuse to meddle.

Focus fidgetiness inwardly better.



Sometimes you pay a high price to return

To where your brightest brilliance burns;

Forget the expense, yet remember to learn.



Strength focuses, and weakness dilutes.

You won't have to go far to find proof;

So where are you of most specific use?



Treat emotions like clouds in the sky -

Try to make out shapes as they pass by,

But don't try asking them to comply.



You are the exception - that's the rule.

Your uniqueness is like powerful fuel

That can draw upon itself for renewal.



When you're ready to pick what's next,

Rethink building out broader breadth:

Go digging down even deeper instead.



What happens when you're untethered?

When you set aside your set schedule,

You may find living livelier better.



Just be open and you will be astonished

At the things others have accomplished

To avoid the task of just being honest.



To heal, even from what's long past,

Reframe how you perceive its grasp.

What you can name, you can outlast.



The misinformed don't mean to lie,

Which makes for all the reason why

You may trust - but let time verify.



Change your approach after that news,

Not because the information has use,

But because time is a powerful tool.



More patience makes more things apparent.

Wait and you'll meet what's truly inherent,

Since time turns all intentions transparent.



Words make promises - and far too many.

Meanwhile, your actions don't make any,

Yet somehow keep accomplishing plenty.



To go farther forward, leave secrets behind,

Both, because of how they clutter the mind,

And because they're always revealed in time.



That one habit keeps getting in your way

By interrupting your choosing for today:

Conscious choices are now your mainstay.



Introduce yourself warmly. Remember names.

Insert sensitive strength into every handshake.

Greet old friends with your sincerest embrace.



Though pouring your time into a thorough plan

May seem and feel, and even be praised as grand,

You master what you stop trying to understand.



In this case, planning big is thinking wrong;

Mastering one tiny detail is thinking strong,

Because it's that one thing that uplifts us all.



Focus on an outlook rather than an outcome.

Choose getting together over getting done as

All we ever truly remember is how much fun.



Grand plans have a way of stumbling

Over their own intricate bumblings;

Love simplicity's graceful humbling.



Their mind's world is theirs alone,

Not yours to rent out as your own.

You have a marvelous inner home.



May your excitement last as long as it can,

And may you also come to gracefully land

Where you feel both grounded and grand.



A gardener's flower is a farmer's weed.

It all depends on what your field needs.

Are you planting your intended seeds?



Of course you've expected this to go faster.

But how quickly haste becomes a disaster -

Becoming patient is becoming of a master.



Not every journey need be a climb.

Not every verse need neatly rhyme:

Cradle your inner child right now.



There is so much left to learn about yourself

That cannot be learned through anyone else,

Because only you can know what you've felt.



Avoid groups that hide in deep discussion

And ones hiding in mindless production:

Show yourself in a way the crowd doesn't.



Thanks from all who your example has awoken.

For now, that recognition comes as this token:

Congratulations on the cycle you have broken.



This will not be about anything you know,

But about the depth of kindness you show -

How well you first make it inwardly grow.



Who are you referencing? Yesterday's you?

The one you should love, and forgive too?

Or today's you, the only one today can use?



Appreciate that you're able to fully feel,

But emotions are an ever-turning wheel

At a time when you need a will of steel.



They're upset with, or unable to comprehend

What you're doing? Don't you break or bend.

Trusting yourself wins them over in the end.



Focus on things others deem insignificant.

Master those and you'll convey a sentiment

That will make everyone feel magnificent.



Even when they don't rise to the occasion,

You don't need to experience frustration,

Because your peace needs no persuasion.



As for the wants you decide to let wait,

Life often elbows those out of its way,

So decide that what you want will stay.



Your sages are closer than you realize,

Wearing friends and foes as a disguise.

Engage with each on your way to wise.



The reason to treat all this as a game

Is to keep you in an attitude of play:

Who's willing to lose is able to gain.



Feel for where your deepest joy is in this,

For where work and play so perfectly mix,

Then make your relocation there quick.



Asking this daily won't be too often:

Are you merely listing the problems,

Or taking steady steps to solve them?



Much as shivering won't get ice unfrozen,

Doing the right task at the wrong moment

Means you must review how you've chosen.



If they've chosen to head that other way,

There's really only so much you can say

(Unless you prefer this mutual delay).



Before choosing to wait until the collision,

Know not making a decision is - a decision

Because time won't await your permission.



Raising your standards raises the stakes

Of how deeply you're willing to engage:

All you choose to, can and will change.



Instead of planning your escape,

Do all that you can as you await

Instruction in how to be great.



That which frustrates

Properly illuminates

Just where to deviate.



Don't overpay attention to one fact,

For there's far more to it than that,

And what you overpay, you attract.



The right response to the wrong trigger

Just makes what's unwanted grow bigger.

When not to respond is for you to figure.



Let them settle for easy answers - not you.

Let independent thought think your truth,

Let it be part inspiration - and part proof.



Unless you want what everyone else has got,

What you need is one independent thought.

Wait until you discover what that's brought!



Quoting favorite wisdom makes you a parrot.

Burying your brightness makes you a carrot.

Sharing your strengths makes love apparent.



All you have to work with here is time,

So set up little, but key daily deadlines,

Which will get you to better prioritize.



As far as attentiveness from day to day,

They just will not care in the same way,

And so, with you, the control must stay.



What you entrust to them to care for,

May not be done so well, so therefore

This is one possibility to prepare for.



Is all your giving being received?

If not, what's all being achieved?

Try going where you're believed.



You'll know by observing your own actions

Whether you've learned more useful tactics

For the next time or two that that happens.



If you doubled the minutes in your day,

Couldn't twice as much get in your way?

How might half as many work the same?



Get today and tomorrow into symmetry

By doing things just a little differently

As you await the gift of synchronicity.



The time you don't spend on it, won't return.

The time you do invest, will continue to earn

Like a kindling flame that grows as it burns.



Don't measure your giving - but focus it

Where you can both receive and benefit,

Where celebration and sacrifice can mix.



Can you speed or slow the cadence of time?

Can't? Control the causes you can in kind:

Cause intention and intensity to combine.



Whether this is a harsh or helpful truth -

Who's around you, reveals what's in you;

Work on where you wander, to improve.



If you're thinking of going back there,

Perhaps you'll also remember to beware

Or at least, clear-headedly compare.



Rather than getting lost in a forest of details,

Notice a few of the paths that this place veils.

What does the straightest way through entail?



Wish to live no one's life but your very own.

Wealth consists of a wondrous inner home.

Health consists of choosing to feel whole.



There's no need for a convincing speech,

No reason to gather up students to teach:

Simply living life has the greatest reach.



Between all you planned and all you did not,

In which were your transformations brought?

Head in directions your expectations cannot.



No, that is not an option.

What have you forgotten?

Courage includes caution.



As conscientiously as you can commit,

Choose who you share your time with.

You're getting better, you must admit.



To not become another source of hurt,

Be aware not to ever assume the worst:

Put positive perspectives last and first.



What is a great idea before you do it?

A nut without a bolt going through it.

You will have to do more than intuit.



Loosen your grip on that overall concept.

Lest it grip you back with stifling regret.

Live loosened - as you have not lived yet.



How has not-sharing about it worked?

Holding heaviness harbors more hurt.

Heal yourself by communicating first.



Grant yourself the supreme authority

Over all you deem yourself fit to feel.

Banish the rest with no future appeal.



Be open to having your opinion changed,

To having all that you knew rearranged,

Yet noticing from the you that's the same.



Answers don't come to you by force,

Nor always by your expected source,

But always by you asking, of course.



To choose your path, give up your search;

Ask others instead, or else ask them first

Where both you and your work converge.



To find your path, do not search:

It is guaranteed to find you first

(and feel like endless self-worth).



Pain can focus you like nothing else.

You usually use it to recover health.

Now use it to do exceptionally well.



Imagine they've accepted you - now what?

Won't it be a different-but-the-same rut?

Isn't this a fine time to follow your gut?



Are they putting in as much work as you?

Or waiting until your efforts bear fruit?

At harvest time, will they be of real use?



To have your deepest needs met

Is something you can truly get

Once you invite an inner reset.



If all your tasks are linked to the short-term,

There's nowhere for your daydreams to turn.

Work on your long shot before today adjourns.



A level of mastery awaits you down the road

In exchange for all that you do on your own,

So do everything you can, except postpone.



In giving your time, being specific is best.

Remember, before answering any request,

A broad no does better than a blanket yes.



Check that you're still doing this for you

By doing a thinking, and feeling, review.

If anything's off, it's time you withdrew. 



If that's still the case, go where you flourish,

Where heart, mind, and soul feel nourished,

Where you give up convenience for courage.



If it's dependent on others, take note:

It means your castle is missing a moat.

Meet these specific needs on your own.



What your dreams want from you are results,

Not excuses. So when they come to consult,

No stories - offer them intent, not impulse.



Since your energy is what sets the tone,

Whether or not you are working alone,

Place yourself in a more blissful zone.



Try that, pause, feel. Try this, pause, feel.

Which one reaches into your deepest zeal?

For which would you skip your next meal?



All that you do thoughtlessly

Also affects the day's destiny,

So bring along some humility.



Of what ever was once true, what is still?

You're proof of so many dreams fulfilled,

But there is more of you yet to be built.



You inspire many more than you realize -

Not because of your dream's scope or size,

But because you refuse to wait or analyze.



Do you recognize who you are in all this?

Are you beginning to feel where you fit?

Is it now clear what to go forward with?



It won't stay like this (don't get too attached).

Teach yourself how to find your own way back

To where your efforts and allies evenly match.



You have this much to be grateful for,

So if ever you do go in search of more,

Uphold all that you treasure and adore.



Unrelated events evoke the same reaction

If to one emotion you have an attraction:

Detach from it and notice what happens.



Forward might require a few steps back

To retrieve things that remained intact

And can now help make greater impact.



You'll have to make the decision to adjust

How you've been doing things. You must

To support all that you'll soon construct.



You can offer so much more so why don't you?

You limit yourself by what anyone else can do.

Why not use the abilities only you're privy to?



Surprises are, by definition, unexpected.

So live openly rather than overprotected,

Sitting right where you'll get perfected!



Have you noticed they're never satisfied?

If you measure, they're costing you time

When Inspiration would've stayed awhile.



If your &ldquo;needs&rdquo; include others, take note.

They're probably ones you should disown;

You're still complete when completely alone.



Remember, you don't get wasted time back,

But also, that time well-spent often attracts

More invitations - ever better ones, in fact.



You can't for them, you can only for you:

Try, but you'll only discover today's truth

(No other day's would be of any real use).



Whether you still feel grateful or not

When life goes other than it &ldquo;ought,&rdquo;

What you can do is by life be taught.



It's not something for you to discuss or debate,

Nor is it something you'd need to demonstrate:

Do what matters most to you, no further delay.



Where they are on their own map to Well

Will be difficult if not impossible to tell;

Wait right here - wait longer on yourself.



That is enough complaining about what they do.

The only one willing and able to act here is you.

Try something old and then try something new.



Thinking you know, versus knowing you know

Is the difference between maybe and what is so.

The first plants seeds that the second one grows.



Do what you feel, based on what you know,

Using your emotions when tossed to or fro

As an inner compass pointing where to go.



If of your weakness, they're taking advantage,

Don't waste energy getting them reprimanded.

Only be sure they go from you empty-handed.



Every thought carries its own sort of voice,

As does every action, inaction, and choice.

Doesn't their tone tell you which to avoid?



Stress drags none but the unprepared.

Being ready always beats being scared.

You know what needs to be repaired...



You think you're losing something you're not.

You simply got your attention snagged/caught

In one part of this greater gift being brought.



It is alright to complain - to get it all out -

But know when to shut complaining down

And get back to what your life is all about.



There's one preferred emotion, a certain feeling

You tend toward, with whatever you're dealing:

Is this a sensation you'd associate with healing?



You're doing too many things - pare down.

Tasks should kindly greet - not surround.

Chances to be by yourself should abound.



You are not the cause nor are you the cure,

Nor can you control (but you can endure)

Their drama by of yourself becoming sure.



This time, for your own sake, do it small

Or else, don't even bother doing it at all

(For it is the bricks that build the wall).



Doing things for the world outside

May not feel quite as false as a lie,

But it's time for you to recognize.



Be sure your motives are clear and true

So there's no way for you to  misconstrue

What, even on a bad day, you're up to.



Perceive things, not as you wish them to be,

But as they are occurring - just realistically:

Now plan your approach more strategically.



You have a natural advantage - use it.

Over time, you can altogether lose it

Unless you take today to improve it.



When you act as the generous host,

Who's taking advantage the most?

Inquire before you get engrossed.



Your friends may not be fit for the task,

But it is still so important that you ask.

Just finding out puts you on your path.



How do you feel on the inside?

What fills you up with pride?

Where could you use a guide?



You have a plan - so give it time to work.

Before ending anything, let it start first.

Trust your process for all that it's worth.



Be aware of the mood you're cultivating

Along with whatever else it's activating:

It becomes what you end up recreating.



So what if things go a little bit wrong,

Messing up how you're moving along?

Let your response be swift and strong.



The difference between plan and action?

The first doesn't face daily distractions.

The last is the face of daily satisfaction.



Redirect those conversations

From directionless recreation

Toward delightful creation.



Examine what you are working on -

Does it hold you as weak or strong?

Will its benefits last you lifelong?



For you to create, you first need room:

So, clear your space of clutter's gloom

As inspiration's light is arriving soon.



Appreciate what you have while you have it.

While it is close enough for you to grab it,

Use it to make improvement a daily habit.



Stop to take in the feedback you're getting.

Stop to take inventory of all you're letting

Stop you from forgiving while forgetting.



Complaints breed complaints, they just do.

So it's wise - if you receive one that's new -

To receive it as an offer you should refuse.



Habits created as a solution to one problem

Create new ones, but then can't solve them.

Detach, and countless answers will blossom.



While you're busy seeking validation,

What's within is giving information.

Why not refocus your concentration?



No one knows a fraction of what you do

About anything going on inside of you,

So you're not the one who has to prove.



The lesson? It's simple: you must wait.

It's not happening on your chosen date,

And yet you need not leave it up to fate.



Whether you honor your reasons as real,

Wait here to truly be with how you feel:

When you do, more of your layers peel.



Own what's yours, the bad and the good.

Own what you must and all you should,

Enough to endure being misunderstood.



Own what's yours, the good and the bad.

Own all that your unpredictability adds.

Own what makes you unpredictably glad.



Does this mood live in a neighborhood

Where it is welcomed and understood?

Your heart is the mayor (so it could).



Going back to get something you gave away

Uses time and energy you could use to stay

Where your effort matters every single day.



Just what are you reactivating with that?

Does your behavior lead forward or back?

Is there something you'd rather attract?



No matter what new opportunity life brings -

What new friends, what new thoughts to think,

The healthiest of each adds balance to things.



Knowledge is power because it brings clarity.

Understanding amidst chaos is a useful rarity,

So learning more will be your act of charity.



Continue creating even if you're unimpressed

With what first comes. Goodness comes next,

Which is followed, in due time, by greatness.



Don't simply accept what you're being told,

Especially if you feel unheard or unknown.

Don't simply buy all that you're being sold.



Don't keep it inside - express this somehow.

Make time for it soon if you can't right now.

Allot more time than their plan for you allows.



Maybe it's not meant to go like that.

Maybe there's a very different path.

Maybe you can be less matter-of-fact.



A schedule is what you genuinely need,

Structure to trim back your time's weeds

As you tend to your lovely garden of deeds.



No, this is not about a lack of resources,

But about the focus that limitation forces.

Can you feel what your ingenuity endorses?



This is not a debate-worthy point to concede.

That's not something on which a life can feed.

There is nothing out there you actually need.



Are those added words meant to impress?

Don't they actually just make more mess?

Can you from the sincerest place express?



Once you begin gathering support outside,

Good excuses begin creating places to hide.

Come out, but come at this from the inside.



Parts of your heart must be protected,

Because in a crowd they get neglected:

A bit of conscious caution is expected.



Vulnerability holds a special place.

It carves out a sacred sort of space

Where others can deliver you grace.



What you're upset about points to the heart

Of the matter, as well as the place to start

As you gather the tools to take things apart.



Does filling roles make you feel necessary?

Whether some role is lifelong or temporary,

Being yourself is what makes you legendary.



Things that feed off of you will stop

Soon after your focus on them drops

(From lack to luck is a simple swap).



Does it call for this much concentration?

Or could you get there by deep relaxation?

Effort and ease go to different destinations.



Effort and ease head in different directions

But do cross paths at some key intersections

If you ever choose to change your intentions.



According to trends, a pattern is clear.

According to patterns, a trend is near.

Your will can force both to disappear.



Discuss crises only long enough to identify

The issue, but stop before things intensify.

Solutions are all that talk should solidify.



If you believe resources must come first,

What if the ones that arrive fare worse

Than just using what already works?



New self, old self, true self, role self...

What you do for others, you do do well,

But who you are is the meaning of wealth.



Congratulations on having this much health,

And good luck gaining more daily for yourself.

Congratulations on feeling increasingly well.



One emotion can infect the whole room.

If it hasn't happened, it will very soon:

Have the one to which others subsume.



Get up from there. Don't you submit

To their unreasonable, unfair tactic.

Rise to rule yourself as you deem fit.



It will take time for you to become whole,

To awaken in body, mind, spirit, and soul;

Each bit more makes more in each unfold.



If you fully understood where you're at,

You wouldn't feel the need to backtrack.

You would act as if success is a pure fact.



Even though tomorrow's outcome isn't clear,

There's a wonderfulness to being right here

That can free you from the desire to steer.



There are no ifs, ands, buts, or maybes...

You're going to have to work on it daily,

Persevering through uncertainty bravely.



Have you figured out what angered you so?

Once you do, next figure out how to grow.

Then, branch out based on what you know.



You should be experiencing the whole range

Of emotions, and if not, consider it strange.

Even light changes colors throughout the day.



Beware if they didn't start at the beginning.

While it indeed takes skill to keep winning,

They won't know which parts need trimming.



Tainted advice can taste noticeably odd:

The fresh part of it is often mere facade,

While the stale part will rot your cause.



Between all the words lives intent.

If you feel what they truly meant,

No more time on it need be spent.



The details you bring into focus

Give new ones a beacon, a locus:

Limit the distractions you notice.



No, you are not in a delusion,

Nor need there be confusion:

Your presence is the solution.



If the solution were anything but love,

That thing would've easily risen above

This thing that we're already made of.



Go get out there - before you overthink.

Get moving. Your concerns will shrink.

Get out there - and discover new links.



Get out there - but without exploiting.

Become more aware, without avoiding.

Get to where more options are pointing.



Get out there because, frankly, it's time.

Come out from there, inside your mind.

There's so much out there for you to find.



It's time: You need to get out there.

You handle when, but let the where

Come about somewhat like a dare.



Enough planning! Go get out there.

The only thing of which to beware

Is not taking life up on today's dare.



A failure is not the end,

It's wisdom's best friend:

Get back out there again.



Getting back out there makes sense.

Once you get back out there again

You're guaranteed one new friend.



The best way forward is back out there,

Where you can breathe the freshest air

If you accept the challenge - this dare.



Enough waiting - get back out there.

What happened didn't have to be fair,

It just had to make you more aware.



Forward doesn't have to be somewhere new,

But it does have to invite something in you

To offer more of your greatest gift - truth.



Acknowledge the tasks that will always be

And don't bother with them so speedily -

Use the time on what you wish secretly.



Carving out time just for yourself

Isn't selfish - it's just good health

Just stopping to do one thing well.



Their limitations need not frustrate you.

They're reminders to try something new

That puts all of your options to good use.



Your sense of humor can serve as a knife

To cut through any stagnation or strife,

And carve a space for you to stay awhile.



Understood, you want more than this.

But what are you willing to do for it?

What needs to go that no longer fits?



Forward is not the opposite of back,

It is the direction you feel attracts

The best in you to rise up and act.



Forward isn't somewhere out there,

It is an inward mission of self-care

So brave it spreads out everywhere.



You are going to embark on this journey

Whether or not you feel ready or worthy.

By starting, your greatness is unfurling.



Your responsibilities will still remain.

Tend to them when you're back again.

Now go, ride your imagination's train.



Before getting your mind set,

You have a long way to go yet.

Does your heart have a request?



Effort and ease

Share one need:

Balance, please.



Clear, honest expression

Is itself its own lesson,

Its own heartfelt blessing.



Whether or not it feels like much fun,

It's the only way it's going to get done:

Manage it toward the desired outcome.



Keep from getting drawn into the whirlpool

By realizing who exactly is playing the fool.

Keep your heart's temperature calmly cool.



Recognize the diversion and press on.

You don't have to settle and get along,

You have to be clear as well as strong.



Relationship means a healthy connection.

Without that, it's merely an intersection.

When in doubt, trust your own perception.



They await being plainly told

You've retired from that role.

Express yourself, then let go.



Things can change rather quickly

By doing what you don't typically.

Yes, you deserve more tranquility.



Unhealthy connections should be cut.

You can unravel ties gradually, but

Might consider speeding things up.



Don't you deserve the gift of compassion?

Can you give yourself one healthy ration?

If you doubled it, what else would happen?



The ability to feel for yourself

Puts you on a journey of health,

First for you, then everyone else.



No, you're not stuck - take charge.

Even if circumstances make it hard,

Your ability to handle it is large.



Are your boundaries being respected?

Or are your limits instead being tested?

If so, should this link be disconnected?



Interest that flows both ways is proper.

You should ask about each other often.

You should each be able to equally offer.



Temper is a tool that gets dull with overuse,

A tool that turned on others turns to abuse,

A tool that exposes and cuts right through.



Who's most interested in your experiences?

Who do you invite over without criteria?

Who loves your laughter and seriousness?



Good feelings are only one part of life.

While you shouldn't wallow in strife,

Feel a full range of emotions, alright?



Are they flexible? Have they compromised?

Do they swiftly adjust when life surprises?

If you asked of them, would they ask why?



There are outcomes you won't expect,

Because your journey isn't over yet.

Stay flexible. Give everyone respect.



Somehow, something inside you always knew,

So what you're now receiving is nothing new:

The question is, what are you willing to do?



Are you receiving some inner signals?

Some may feel like complicated riddles,

But tell them you're a humble beginner.



What were you like before this got underway?

How did you used to spend time any given day?

Which parts of the past would you like to stay?



You've been free to choose the whole time.

Now that you recognize this power inside,

It's as if you've gotten to live out two lives.



Should you become more self-contained?

More right, or perhaps more left-brained?

Or perhaps even a bit more unrestrained?



Are you reflecting on your situation?

Do you need any more information?

Can you offer it pure observation?



Thoughts are thoughts, emotions are emotions.

No one outside you can cause much commotion

If you commit to yourself with daily devotion.



That self-defeating tendency is beatable

By knowing improvement is feasible,

And that your dreams are reachable.



Who is more book than brochure?

Who makes you feel most secure?

Who makes your heart reassured?



When it's time, you'll be ready.

You'll go heartfelt from heady.

You'll go from shaky to steady.



Those restrictions are ridiculous.

Rather than be more meticulous,

Find a way that feels frictionless.



Let them choose their own way.

But by your own standards stay,

And let nothing lead you astray.



Notice, signs are everywhere: synchronicities.

Whatever you think about all or any of these,

Doesn't each one arrive with evermore ease?



What's more important, details or the vision?

What's more powerful, fact or more opinion?

What's more useful, discussion or decision?



Are you armed with an answer?

There needs to be a chance for

The question to expand more.



Time has made one option unrealistic;

All the more reason to grow optimistic

Over your most timeless characteristics.



It is not being wildly emotional

Nor your being tame and rational

That makes you most powerful...



Your joy won't be found out there.

It is already waiting right where

You keep what you give true care.



Whether the critics poke or jab,

You begin with what you have,

Not what you can hastily grab.



Never stop to wish this were easier,

Or wish for the wind to be breezier.

Against will, what good is either?



Are you waiting for their response

Rather than continuing right along

As if you're who you're counting on?



You have no business turning around,

Stopping, climbing all the way down,

Or doing anything but gaining ground.



Why not deem doubt to be delirious?

Why not frame fantasies as serious?

Why not call compliance curious?



When will you settle into yourself,

Let body, mind, heart, soul, meld,

And care less about anything else?



You can rely on things moving forward

At a pace that won't allow for boredom,

But being still will always be in order.



There will always be things that bedazzle,

And complications that create a big hassle.

Your main challenge is to remain unbaffled.



What doesn't challenge you lets you be,

Which isn't bad by itself, necessarily.

But you grow after a good uprooting.



That's enough, once and for all, enough.

Let this decide, if deciding's too tough.

Your standards need to be pointing up.



Skepticism won't serve you. Take a chance.

Stay centered, yet simultaneously, advance.

Savor this sense of adventure choice grants.



What problems you can, fix.

From the rest, duly unhitch.

Enough and too much don't mix.



Honor boundaries where you find them.

Then identify intruders, and bind them.

Establish your manners and mind them.



Why follow their convention?

To avoid imagined rejection?

Become your best invention.



Beyond that, what's true?

From your point of view,

Shouldn't you matter too?



Set it aside. Now, reflect a moment:

Is this the way you want to grow it?

How about a day-long postponement?



If you're thinking about it the easy way,

Isn't there more than what's on display?

Could you get your thinking to change?



If you don't, nothing will change.

Everything will continue this way.

Decide what will no longer remain.



This choice affects all future ones -

That's simply how things get done.

A naive choice beats making none.



Yes, how it feels does matter.

As you end your old patterns,

More good momentum gathers.



Do they have something you want?

Do they not-so-innocently taunt?

Do you prefer to not stay caught?



This is simply nothing you need.

It has become a parasite you feed.

How about doing things differently?



First you'll have to clear out the time

Before what's coming next can arrive,

Yet you couldn't rush it if you tried.



There are a few more layers here

Than were initially made clear,

That only you can make appear.



It's not more advice you need,

But you deserve to feel freed

Of living at a certain speed.



When will you be ready to introspect,

To consider yourself, to self-reflect,

To face your inner sources of stress?



Do you really think so?

Is that the way to go?

Do you actually know?



Can you ever truly know?

If you dare to answer no,

Then more options show.



If those tend to change,

Maybe this is that stage

From which you refrain.



You perceive in them what you are yourself.

This reminder will help you do quite well:

You're best at buying what you already sell.



You have a quality - a glow

Worth more than you know

To get their best to show.



Would you know what to do if you got it?

Even better than knowing to not flaunt it

Is knowing if it is you who even wants it.



Don't you also start thinking like that

Because of what else it might attract.

Keep your train of thought on track.



You have an inner voice, like it or not,

That speaks to you just when it ought.

And what a thoughtful one you've got!



Being exactly what's needed is noble,

But that's a tiny aspect, not the total

Of all that you have at your disposal.



You're ready. You know what to choose.

There is no situation in which you lose,

Since every experience can be put to use.



Though self-care is for you alone,

Share some time you call your own

With others who feel like home.



No one else knows how you work.

No one else feels your same hurt.

What you know of you has worth.



If you make the time,

It will be worthwhile

To go and reconcile.



What you need is time alone

To figure it out on your own

Where you feel most at home.



Are you perceiving all it really is?

Does everything make sense or fit?

What must you actually deal with?



That one is not the right decision -

Trust your experience or intuition.

Allow it to feel internally-driven.



You know more than you realize,

So you can trust you'll recognize

If this is something in disguise.



Do you confront and then some?

Do you do that often or seldom?

Do you need to confront them?



That's logical - but based on what?

Based on having researched enough?

Or based on leveling yourself up?



You're okay - you'll be alright.

Get up. You more than might

Feel the feeling of your light.



On the subject of self-talk that hurts,

Negativity likes to speak lots and first;

Positivity just uses "Love" as its word.



Your inner corners don't need much light

To lose their darkness and become bright.

To do so, just tell them it will be alright.



How much light versus how much dark

Outdoes the other and makes its mark?

You'll learn the moment you embark.



Secrets eventually all get uncovered,

So live as if your secret's discovered

To find yourself greatly recovered.



Get out into nature, even just outside

Until that buzz of thinking subsides.

Let nature seep deep into your mind.



Don't worry, they'll return if you're real.

If you're concerned with how they all feel

You'll create for yourself perpetual appeal.



Those negative ideas never stay for long,

Because it is hard for them to stay strong

While you're telling them they're wrong.



The effort behind a negative thought

Amounts precisely, exactly to naught

Against love positivity has brought.



There is of course good and bad stress.

Drop the kind that plops piles of mess.

You want the kind that bates your best.



Buy good, have good.

Invest? You should.

Is this understood?



Cheap becomes expensive eventually.

So instead of spending resentfully,

Invest time early and generously.



Of all the things you tell yourself today,

Could you add this in some kind of way?

Your arrival makes a room say, &ldquo;Hooray!&rdquo;



Be even more positive and wait.

Notice it go from good to great

Just by allowing it to come late.



You're almost there. Somehow you knew

You would have to be the one to choose,

And as a reward for it, you're wiser, too!



Reroute your trip around that commotion

(or delay yourself by becoming beholden):

Go where the light feels wholly golden.



Provide them with the support they need,

And they'll amaze with how they proceed

To transform and thus help you succeed.



Critical thoughts have their place

(way out in the darkness of space).

Even tiny kindnesses illuminate.



Regardless of what they did or will,

To choose is to live a life fulfilled:

Your happiness is your choice still.



What you can't even imagine awaits

Not due to any of the forces of fate,

But because you just don't hesitate.



If one amazing thought is all it takes

To take over your whole entire day,

Let that one thought be oh-so great.



Finish what matters, forget what won't.

Work on some things that others don't.

Do what you know benefits the most.



It doesn't have to be what you expect

To enrich, uplift, enlighten, bless,

Or to lead you to what comes next.



Compared to who you were yesterday,

How are you? How have you changed?

Have you noticed the subtle upgrade?



Mistakes do not define, they deliver

Opportunities for you to administer

Improvements along your perimeter.



How else would you learn and grow

But by facing what you don't know?

This is how greatness is bestowed.



Problems are not annoying delays,

They are feedback to help change

What you think of as your way.



A new joy is on its way if you'll allow.

You don't have to know when or how.

What you'll need is within you now.



Successful, confident, powerful, strong,

Someone with whom people get along,

And you're also right where you belong.



Who you are cannot be taught,

So there's no teacher you ought

To ask to think your thoughts.



You don't need to do that anymore.

That can no longer serve you, nor

Will it lessen tomorrow's chores.



Just in case you forgot or are unaware,

You don't have time to go back there.

You have things for which to prepare.



If you don't stop it, no one will ask.

They'll thank you for doing the task,

Knowing you can do more than that.



You limit yourself by staying here.

Dare yourself. Make your way clear

And venture out, green yet sincere.



If you don't decide this has been enough,

You'll slide down into a wide, circular rut

From which you'll eventually get unstuck.



If things are hectic once again,

You need to relearn this lesson:

Preparation outshines intention.



Once you leave your comfortable place

And venture out into wide open space,

You'll learn what's useful versus waste.



Take your qualifications lightly.

They bind you to the past tightly.

Freed from them you are mighty.



You will progress if you persist.

They will help you if you insist.

You will get there if you wish.



Notice how it takes so very little

To break what is already brittle:

Strengthening yourself is critical.



A bit of encouragement goes a long way,

So what you do to uplift yourself today,

Could help in a storm, come what may.



Where would you be without that story?

Without so much word-based inventory,

Won't you finally be freely exploring?



Just a little farther to go

To escape the undertow

And brave your unknown.



This time is going to be different

For you have focused your interest

Onto something personally specific.



You are so close. Go deeper, further.

You are no longer just the observer -

You are the only one with the fervor.



It may hurt,

But you first

Do the work.



Do you know what your skills are?

Like fuel, they'll take you very far.

Like water, they're your reservoir.



Live as if you may have been wrong

About what has mattered all along.

Questioning will make you strong.



What is here and now will be there and gone

So focus on projects you feel will last long,

Ones that are equal to your sense of a dawn.



You're allowed to enjoy this even more

Than you ever allowed yourself before,

If you were a lion, it'd be time to roar.



Do not wait to be celebrated,

Nor fret being loved or hated:

Live to be self-appreciated.



It's not a competition, this is your life.

Let your motivation come from inside.

If you need help, try taking your time.



Above all, seek to be honest -

Not about what you promised,

But of what you are fondest.



Your needs go beyond the ones you state.

They're further, deeper, and if you wait,

They'll explain. Lovingly accommodate.



The importance of deepening your honesty

Into the questions of who you wish to be,

Is that this lets today add to your dream.



You were right, but not like you thought.

So in gloating, don't get yourself caught.

Just keep trusting yourself as you ought.



You can take a wholly different approach.

While on your old habits it may encroach,

It might guarantee you healthier growth.



There is a more direct approach

That can give you full control:

You have to do it on your own.



What do you imagine will happen then?

What if the same problem arises again?

What if you stopped skipping to the end?



What is the overall, long-term goal

You will reach with that approach?

Will who you become be your own?



Your dream is beautiful, and it's yours

To frequently visit and fully explore.

Do wilder dreams await? Of course!



Your reasons are the most important thing.

The good reasons can accomplish anything.

The best reasons succeed just by beginning.



Somewhere in their story there's a gap

Where their point gets lost or trapped.

Delve deeper, right straight into that.



You need to make clear that it's too much

Unless you think you haven't had enough.

Either way, fill your directness with love.



There are more factors than you've considered.

So to prevent your crops from getting withered,

Plant them where more nutrients get delivered.



Are you aware of the amount you'll need?

The weeks of hours it will take to succeed?

You can surely do it. Therefore, proceed.



The longer you take to share your story,

The sooner you'll risk finding it boring.

Wouldn't you rather keep on exploring?



Sooner than later you'll need to stop,

To let all the hustle and bustle drop,

To let what remains rise to the top.



It can be uncomfortable to do,

But it really is time to choose

Between all of that and truth.



The only things that you &ldquo;deserve&rdquo;

Are those you're willing to preserve

By dedicating your time to serve.



Close some chapters before you must

Because sometimes it is best to trust

That making space is best unrushed.



Anytime you are offered a prediction,

Receive it with all rightful suspicion,

Because the future defies description.



Asking the right question is never wrong,

Because asking goes past where it belongs

To bring back answers you can count on.



Ask, and you'll never be wrong.

Ask, and you'll become strong.

Ask, and you'll soon get along.



By asking, you prevent being incorrect,

You get help figuring out what's next,

And filter out who doesn't know yet.



Are you asking the right question?

What else might you also mention?

Is the asking, itself alone, a lesson?



Seek better experts, find better guesses.

Ask better questions, learn better lessons.

Get better answers, make better suggestions.



What's the best question you could ask?

That would focus in on the right task?

And put what matters back on track?



There's no outer bone without inner marrow.

Likewise, the bow is what without an arrow?

Give up your broad concepts for the narrow.



What would establish more trust,

Break the sense of them versus us?

First build a bridge? Yes, you must.



You have no use for extremes.

Nothing is what it may seem,

So explore what's in between.



Whether a treaty or a truce,

Whatever you decide to do,

Let it be between you two.



Try to ask the best question -

One truly worthy of mention

That shows you pay attention.



The warmth of a really good question

Lets you relax while paying attention.

Study yourself down to the inflection.



Your road has been so far from straight,

And this is something we all celebrate:

It's the turns that have made you great.



You get there via connection.

So that's enough apprehension:

Give them your full attention.



You have to get new rest.

Refuel your special zest.

Sleeping better is... best.



Be the one who listens best,

Who waits until the very end

To offer up your sentiment.



Until they share, you don't know

All the special treasures they hold:

Always be the one who listens most.



Listen to your entire self

As if it were someone else

Speaking of their health.



Commentary that is not firsthand

May only secondarily understand:

Get it from the source if you can.



Time grants you everyone's stories;

Being patient gets you inventories

Worth of wisdom awaiting always.



Like a compass that is missing a north,

Information is useless without warmth.

So do everything with love henceforth.



Work harder and cut the time in half

That it normally take to do all that.

Then you will be ahead of the pack.



As you get closer, a power will surface

That's within you for no other purpose

Than to endlessly refuel true service.



They're not as you expect them to be,

But as they've been most frequently

For whoever checked most recently.



The sheer amount you're able to achieve

Depends on how often you're able to be

Unavailable - lost to somewhere deep.



Hopefully you are finally ready

To receive support that's steady,

Strong, and cerebral, not heady.



Observe your own emotionality.

Is this your chosen personality?

Or past, knee-jerk practicality?



If you stay and listen to the end,

Sincerely, and with no pretense,

You're guaranteed a new friend.



Come out from your inner workshop.

People would love to meet you. Stop:

Connect with them (take today off).



Let your response be measured

So it can someday be treasured

For how it told, yet pleasured.



You have so much more you can give.

First find out what you need to live,

Then get ready: Dive all the way in.



Decide whether you bore of the wordy

And would rather be on your journey,

To seek water or discuss being thirsty.



You'll be surprised how quickly you arrive

Once you make a few plans and then strive.

Work is one wonderful part of being alive.



What's the best thought to think now?

Is it of a who, what, when, or a how?

Sometimes all you need to do is allow.



There's a better thought you can think

That can pull you back from the brink

With one single, heartwarming wink.



All counterproductive thoughts set aside,

And resoundingly better ones on the rise,

All is possible when you improve inside.



Get it done while you have this feeling.

Do what's hard, and then do what's easy.

Then you'll have more time for healing.



This time, do what's easy, then what's hard.

Because you need to practice taking charge

In a way that graduates from small to large.



Don't bother with the easy, do what's hard.

Open yourself up, and let down your guard.

Remember you are the one who's in charge.



A mistake is just a mistake, so make amends.

Apologize, forgive yourself, tie up loose ends,

And remember, above all, not to do it again.



It's not ridiculous - it just is what it is.

You don't have to feel any way about it,

But is it what you're able to deal with?



It's not going to come overnight,

So expect only occasional delight

Until time grants you that right.



Does something inside tell you it's right?

Then follow that all the way to its light.

Here, at the source of it, is it as bright?



Tomorrow holds whatever it does,

But don't think on it too much.

Just let today hold you in love.



Divide the work into bits that make sense,

And then begin, without being too intense,

Treating each as its own complete segment.



These three sentences have lost their point.

But don't let that get anything out of joint.

Use all the mental space they didn't exploit.



Whether you ever realized or made the link,

You also have feelings about how you think.

So don't rush your thoughts to be succinct.



Does there always have to be a point?

Must every thought be given a voice?

Which ones would you rather avoid?



The subjects you choose not to discuss

Are often the ones that actually must

Be brought up in order to build trust.



By asking good questions, what you make

Is somewhere someone's thoughts create

Even more options, and even more space.



Giving yourself some space,

What you additionally make

Is a landing spot for grace.



Via the experts is how it's normally done.

They may have all the answers. So what?

Finding your own way there is the fun.



Who else would you want to know?

How would you like it to unfold?

What would you love to be told?



Without a past to reference,

You'll be more adventurous

(And even more generous).



Let go of what's taken hold of you

To get courageously closer to truth

And liberatingly loyal to a new you.



Being loyal to a lofty idea or cause

Is pointlessness if you never pause

To be loyal to yourself just because.



Halfway is part of the length, but not all.

Don't let premature praise be your flaw.

Go the rest of the way with joyful calm.



Vent for as long as you need, but then stop,

Lest into a loop of lack lore you get caught.

Progress picks up where pain gets dropped.



Of the things you could think to say,

None will be as effective either way

Over your lovingly silent embrace.



You have to finish. You can't stop now.

Exhausted? Sorry, but press on anyhow.

This chapter's called Sweat of My Brow.



Don't get attached to the promise of goals.

They're just guardrails along your life road

Which actually heads to Points Unknown.



Just a bit more. You're almost there.

Consider this thing to be life's dare,

And bravely go to meet it anywhere.



You're almost where the next part begins.

So, square your shoulders, tuck your chin,

And take it as a given you're going to win.



How many before you reach your fill?

What number comes after your until?

Which amount is equal to your will?



What you're facing is your current limit,

Which only grows from what you give it

(Yes, your critics are going to be livid).



What you need is a good rest

To once again feel your best.

To sleep well is to be blessed.



Who can you possibly meet next?

What would you hope to express?

What do you hope they request?



The people you don't yet know

Can cause your greatest growth

So long as you wish it to be so.



Come back out the moment you're able

Because things don't have to be stable

For you to make your own appraisal.



You decide if it's another loop,

And trust you know what to do

To get yourself out of it soon.



Took so long to come, so soon it passed.

Now you find yourself in the aftermath.

Returning home to yourself is what lasts.



Don't go where they say to.

Go where it interests you.

Go somewhere they refuse.



Avoid anywhere there's a convention,

Where there's no room for expression.

You keep on seeking new dimensions.



It's time to find that friend

With whom you feel time bend

And ask to do so once again.



Yes, it is important to respond,

But not endlessly, all day long.

For one hour of today, be gone.



Quickly now, get on with it.

Time is up, but do not quit

(To pour, you need to tip).



You have a state of operation

That pushes past obligations

And pulls in collaboration.



Don't stop to think right now

(couldn't if you tried anyhow).

You'll soon be tired but proud.



No, you don't deserve any of that.

But if you're able to remain intact,

The reward is it won't come back.



Hold your ground. Maintain your peace,

No matter what chaos refuses to cease.

You will have this inner oasis at least.



Products nor services long uplift.

Why not? Because you are the gift,

You are the only present that fits.



Operate from your principles,

Your precious inner minerals.

Sometimes be unconditional.



They misunderstand all you try to share

And they're not seeking to become aware.

What you can do is leave them right there.



Time is on your side if you reflect

On which feeling serves you best.

Each moment gives a practice test.



Their moods needn't affect yours.

You're not trapped there anymore.

Congratulations, you've endured.



If your questions are too superficial,

The answers won't even be beneficial.

Offer shallow ones a swift dismissal.



Go deeper still, and deeper than you've gone,

Past where you always comfortably belonged,

Even past what you've imagined as &ldquo;beyond.&rdquo;



Answering questions about the wrong thing

Will plop you right back at the beginning.

For help, just imagine bad questions stink.



The day delivers everyone distractions

That get in the way of... taking action.

To cut right through, give satisfaction.



Of the things you're supposed to do,

Which ones actually appeal to you?

Which do you feel you're meant to?



Whether it was meant to be hurtful,

It affected you somewhere internal.

Have you considered role reversal?



How do you want to perceive it?

Does anyone need to believe it?

Choose well and then receive it.



Connections call for patience and time.

Connect by being trustworthy and kind.

Connections you rush aren't worthwhile.



Don't bring your truth to their errors,

Try bringing your errors to their truth,

So your humility will offer mutual use.



Believe and keep moving forward,

Past your most uncharted borders.

Now you're moving toward them.



For something you need, you'll search.

But will you also do thorough research

So you don't pick what you find first?



You felt it: They've tested your limit.

They've shown you what you'll give it.

What will you do with this new spirit?



What is important to you is what matters.

Over time, others' opinions go to tatters.

Staying true is how momentum gathers.



If it only works if someone else acts,

It's a plan you'd be wise to take back:

Be the whole you you hope to attract.



There is nothing out there - it's all here.

Here is your guaranteed source of sincere,

The only place you can know feels clear.



There are levels of clarity you'll visit,

But your time there always has a limit

As your next level arrives in a minute.



If you find it exhausting, it could be

That you're just doing it incorrectly,

So try out other ways experimentally.



The next door opens before you realize,

And it opens to invite, not to surprise;

You'll decide if you should go inside.



They can want to help all they choose,

But this is something only you can do.

There is only room for one, not a few.



Your worst mistakes will affect others.

But they forgive you because they love

You and all you're doing to rise above.



Perfection is never a worthwhile goal,

Because after it, how will you grow?

Strive to flow with every unknown.



Don't become &ldquo;the best there ever was.&rdquo;

Become the first example they think of

If someone says, &ldquo;a life lived with love.&rdquo;



Learn from these mistakes: Adjust.

Do things differently, and you must

Give your next tries all your trust.



You're allowed to make mistakes and should.

How else will you learn how to go from good

To great to someone they'd be if they could?



You are a mosaic of mistakes and comebacks,

And for your creation you deserve congrats.

They're beautiful, all your lovely contrasts.



Mistakes are guaranteed, and desirable.

In order to become usefully reliable,

Be ever increasingly more advisable.



This is just the beginning of a journey.

The rest unfolds as you become worthy

Of yourself (may happen late or early).



Nicely done, but ignore this praise.

You would have succeeded anyway.

Be less interested in what we say.



Remember, you're not here for them.

You're here to find yourself again.

Take your time. Don't overextend.



You've put your old story on top of this

Without checking to see if it even fits.

It doesn't, and can be done away with.



Do you feel obligated? Why, exactly?

Can you examine it matter-of-factly?

When you do, uproot all of it aptly.



Your emotions give your life flavor,

And can even help keep things stable.

Notice them as often as you're able.



There is nothing to explain.

Go, and get back to it again

Until you feel the change.



When the need outweighs your desire

The embers will become a raging fire

Whose reach is sprawling and entire.



The time it will take you gets shortened

By noting what's not in their assortment.

The unstated is often the most important.



Don't overlook yourself in the least;

You're a fantastic conduit for peace.

By realizing, you get it to increase.



There are those who think (and it's crazy),

That you shouldn't rise above your raising.

When in truth, you must rise above it daily.



To &ldquo;not think more of oneself than one ought,&rdquo;

Is a sticky web in which &ldquo;oneself&rdquo; gets caught,

Easily escaped by letting one's stuck self drop.



Think more of yourself than you &ldquo;ought,&rdquo;

To sorely spite those who'd have you not.

They'll soon join other things you forgot.



Especially if they're prone to extremes,

Take it all in, graciously, if you please,

And remember nothing is what it seems.



It is getting closer! So take heart,

For yes, it will soon be time to start.

For now, do the getting ready part.



There are things that won't help,

So to them, don't help yourself

(better choices, better health).



People offer you all sorts of gifts.

Some are useful - some won't fit.

As quickly as you can, get over it.



When worry speaks, less is heard.

When courage talks, things occur.

Which one's voice do you prefer?



Establish your standards. If and when

Something arises to challenge them,

Go revisit each and every one again.



Recovering is a good thing, but not forever.

Break the loop of getting worse then better

By preparing yourself without the pressure.



If they're merely listening to entrap,

You can't take your own words back,

But use fewer in the future, perhaps.



The more you do in preparation for then,

The easier it will be when it's time again

(You're learning to be your own friend).



Make it easier for yourself by detaching

From whatever causes all this thrashing.

It's a matter of things just mismatching.



Lay some rewards out to motivate yourself

To finish without stopping to ask for help;

Just enough distraction can work very well.



That couldn't be the only reason, but assume

That that's enough of a reason, then resume

Taking the initiative in getting done soon.



Your body is a wild, untamed animal

That's unpredictable yet manageable

If your methods are understandable.



There are only so many directions to choose.

Make up your mind as to what you want to do

(Likewise, what you're done trying to prove).



An apology does not make a good crutch.

It might bear some weight, but not much.

They can though, lean on actions and such.



You are so close that it makes sense

For you to tell yourself if and when

You get there, that will be the end.



Doesn't chaos imply action?

And stillness, satisfaction?

Beware your interactions.



You can get tired, but not discouraged.

All of your efforts need to be concerted

Toward wherever hope can be asserted.



Drastic words fly out from powerlessness,

Calm ones, from a state of contentedness.

What about yours? Do they give a sense?



Keep staying focused on your hardest task.

How do you feel about your thoughts? Ask.

Find more feelings that keep you on track.



Maybe it seemed so easy from the outside,

But now you understand it will take time.

The fact that you know is the bright side.



Feeling bored? It means you're disengaged -

Well, not all of you, but at least your brain.

You need a challenge, or at most, a change.



Let them do exactly as they might,

No reason for you not shine bright.

No shadow has ever covered up light.



You have a bright side, and a dark one too.

Which suits the situation is all up to you.

Is letting them sway you how to choose?



Letting them sway your mood

Lets them swap roles with you.

Lend them back the part of Fool.



If you learned that group was at an end,

Would you be finding another to attend?

On what does your sense of self depend?



You made one very right decision today

That won't be very clear, not until they

Run their course right out of your way.



You can't prove your point to a crowd

(that tends to respond to what's loud),

So go where contemplation's allowed.



The feeling you are feeling is accurate;

There is little point to being passionate

Unless your purpose is compassionate.



Feeling overworked is a good sign. 

You've done too much. It is time

To get some rest for your mind.



Feeling bored is a good sign:

You can do more. It is time

To go challenge your mind.



Feeling angry is worthy of note.

Is it because of who approached?

Is it a feeling that you invoked?



Perhaps the feeling is telling the truth.

You don't belong here because it's you

Who doesn't yet have what you need to.



It's not forever, but it is some number

That you'll find yourself over or under.

To come closer, become unencumbered.



There is no grand scheme to consider,

Because your picture need be no bigger

Than when you were just a beginner.



You can do big things in little places.

In fact, it is the way least complicated

That gets the big things accommodated.



Do less to accomplish more.

Yes, there are needs galore.

But they were there before.



No is a complete sentence.

It fully says what is meant -

It declares your independence.



For what it's worth, who knows.

You could be far or very close.

Whatever your pace, try slow.



But what do you want?

To catch or be caught?

To start or to stop?



Be so careful with those labels.

Drop them, soon as you're able.

Become independently stable.



Where do you hope this goes?

What if that's nowhere close?

It eclipses what you propose.



You will reach another limit,

Another pausing place to visit.

Rest, then give it all you give it.



Your intuition serves you correctly:

Tomorrow benefits you immensely,

And thus, everyone else indirectly.



How much are you willing to devote?

Just enough, and your odds are remote.

Plenty, and you're guaranteed your goal.



You are so much more than a timeline.

In fact, searching your past won't find

Any guarantee you'd become this wise.



Whatever results are being foretold,

Based on what is supposedly known,

Forget the unpredictability you hold.



Without any of your knowledge, you still

Wield power over every situation and will

Whenever you're expecting to be fulfilled.



You'll reach your tipping point very soon

That will turn your single effort into two

In terms of the impact it has, even on you.



Every action has at least two inflections,

Two ways it can be done and/or intended.

Choose the one that is sincerity-blended.



If you could express it better, would you?

Then gather all the options you could use

And figure out the one you should choose.



You're only a little bit off your mark.

All you need to do is maybe disembark,

Reorient, and declare a one-day restart.



You'll do great things when you control

Your ability to retreat then feel whole.

You'll greet your previously unknown.



Complaining walks atop a narrow fence,

A dangerous dance of discontentedness

(The landing can make quite a mess).



By now you know you've got the strength

Without putting yourself through a test.

But do you know to use it for what's best?



Even if you feel you waited too long,

You still have options you can call on.

One new idea makes up for ten bygone.



It's your environment, your surroundings

That make you someone this astounding,

And this proof will keep compounding.



Resourcefulness is what you owe,

A living example of how to know

When to rise above, or dig below. 



People you'll never meet depend on you.

They benefit from the best you choose

For yourself that accrues and accrues.



People you don't even know need you,

Because each of them is connected to

Someone who has been blessed by you.



All you need to uphold is your standard.

Your terms won't need to be demanded,

Nor will you leave them empty-handed.



Inevitably, someone will find out,

But it is nothing to worry about:

It makes you relatable throughout.



It's neither duty nor matter-of-fact:

You don't have to engage with that.

If you don't want to, just move back.



Give everyone a chance or two,

But after that a serious review

(Your time is yours to refuse).



Be reliable

For awhile,

Then pliable.



If there's nothing to say, then don't.

If it's not a will, assume it's a won't.

If you're done, don't hold out hope.



If your conversations spiral,

Then give them up for awhile.

Let silence be more your style.



There is a joy in reconnecting

That if freed from expecting,

Needs no course correcting.



Stop framing things to conceal your flaws.

Start getting straight down to the cause -

Even if you need to slow things to a pause.



That's enough going outside yourself

To study abundance, peace, or health.

In you, all of these are covered well.



Keep your desires as simple as you can

So you can enjoy easily and withstand

If you're asked to settle for less than.



Simplicity will be your best friend

By helping you settle for less than.

Let complexity meet its own end.



What exactly are you talking about?

Some idea you just won't do without?

Without others does it even count?



Question it - question everything.

The answer will call for emptying,

An end to your clever leveraging.



Go out. Find groups. Notice yourself.

Are you still you - or someone else?

What aspects have you always upheld?



Keep moving forward. Don't ever stop.

Every new day let one more thing drop.

You'll be leaving with what you brought.



Respect is a practice of making room

Before you know what else you'll do.

Give deep respect, and receive it too.



Mistakes you make when with others

Are meant to smooth, not to smother,

To help you put your foibles asunder.



Your daily practice is your sculptor,

Creating from who you were before.

Your rituals are what make you more.



Your rituals are what make you this.

What does each help you deal with?

Get rid of rituals that no longer fit.



When you must be firm, why the guilt?

By all your shades your light is built.

To illuminate, sometimes it must tilt.



Sometimes bold moves stir up guilt.

Movement is how you wash away silt.

Flushing is how a clear flow is built.



Can you be both, busy and present at once?

What if there were nothing else to adjust?

What if chaos and calm are equally blunt?



What if you don't need any realizations

To experience a life of ongoing elation?

Here equals now is the whole equation.



If you're working on anyone but yourself,

You're guaranteed an endless ask for help.

You're the only project you can do well.



As you reach any project's end,

A part of you will start to bend

And break through anew again.



Nothing is as difficult as you imagine.

The process is somewhat like a pageant,

Solutions appearing in different fashion.



Others help make you what you'll be,

By doing anything but letting you be,

Awakening your inner powers that be.



Thing follows thing, so be mindful.

Keep brief things that feel prideful,

And linger on what feels delightful.



If their words seem too preplanned,

What you might come to understand

Is they are making subtle demands.



Hold space for others to express,

Not because you listen the best,

But so they'll externally process.



Ask someone to let you vent,

Not to echo your sentiment, 

But so you can process again.



Process the events as you can,

Not trying to fully understand,

But to find somewhere to land.



Always remember to notice the details,

Because, as you so know, life never fails

To hide clever clues on how to prevail.



Coming up with your own way through

Sharpens the skills you can always reuse

To build roads, bridges, and tunnels too.



Before you get stuck in a heady place,

Follow your heart to some loving space

And forget about everything but grace.



You're not here to spout what you know.

You're here to be an example as you grow.

You're here to teach by what you show.



What you reap is what you sow,

What you teach is what you show,

What you free is what you know.



Enjoy your emotions. Train your thoughts.

Where one is freed, the other gets caught.

To balance between them, observe a lot.



You are almost there, once again -

Another climb is nearing its end.

The next peak isn't if, but when.



None of your adjectives matter here.

Drop your history and begin to peer

Into yourself with a lens that is clear.



Stop, are you doing this for you or them?

On which does your sense of self depend?

How much of this are you willing to upend?



Go all the way, since you've made it this far.

Dreaming yourself past sun, moon, and stars.

Keep going past who you were and even are.



This is what's possible, if you can grasp.

This is what's possible. You can just ask.

Do. Allow. Believe. Start with one task.



What you move toward is moving toward you,

So the only other helpful thing you could do

Is proceed openly, with nothing left to prove.



You don't always have to be steady, 

But it helps if you've trained already

So whatever you face can feel petty.



This is an urgent order:

Inch your way forward.

Check today's corners.



It's almost time to rest,

But the time is not yet.

Find what you must get.



Remember your training and you will thrive

In the very places where most barely survive.

Forgot the training? It is: You're still alive.



Keep going. Understand?

Do more. Don't demand.

You do because you can.



It's okay, and you're alright.

You remain, shining bright.

It is not your time to fight.



Your inner peace can handle war.

In fact, it should also be good for

Whoever hasn't had peace before.



Wondering what it's all about?

You must always keep account:

What goes in, must come out.



There will be mistakes along the way. 

The trick is to not give in to dismay.

Learn one thing new every single day.



Your calm just may

Save this very day

From its disarray.



More awaits. Life is full of surprises

(What is felt and what materializes).

How wonderful to live life unguided!



You solve things, so this will be hard

For you to stay here, wait, not start,

And let them first fully do their part.



Take your time, but gain ground.

Keep your spirits up, head down.

Look into - and not just around.



Exhaustion is not ideal,

But it will help you feel

Why rest has such appeal.



If you can't tell what's next,

Do what feels like progress

Until there is more to test.



To take it to the very end

Of your inner limits, then

Find rest is to transcend.



When you cannot possibly give more,

You'll discover what else is in store

That you never knew you had before.



Be the water, not the sieve.

Powers come once you give.

So let your generosity live.



Give your time, not your funds.

Money buys... and then is done.

Time can always bless everyone.



When you're tired, when do you rest?

The moment you feel that tired sense,

Or only once it's blanketed in stress?



Looking to the future is not a ploy,

But a way to call seriousness a decoy.

This is far from the end - so enjoy!



There will be time for that.

But right now, get on track:

Choose what you'll attract.



Numbers are for measuring -

Not for stockpile treasuring;

To numbers, no surrendering.



Even if you give in briefly to rest,

You'll awaken ready for what's next.

Something in you keeps trying again.



Every day is unique and new,

And every opportunity is too.

So today, what's all here to do?



It's not the end,

So you can begin

Again and again.



Perseverance is your greatest tool

And should become your daily rule

Despite the days it may feel cruel.



Congratulations, even for sorrow...

Grief must be lived, not borrowed.

True feelings withstand tomorrow.



Figure out which things can wait.

Once you have, start to calculate

The time you will use to create.



They may have an ulterior motive,

So be aware where they're closest,

And take an extra special notice.



Their interpretation of your facts

Is simply nowhere close to exact,

It simply shows where they're at.



There's only so far you can go

Before fatigue takes control,

So build rest into your goals.



To decide what you want to do next,

You don't need even one more concept:

What you need is a bit of retrospect.



Don't ask what's next. Ask what's here.

This will make your perception clear,

Which may then point out a new peer.



You need them in order to succeed.

You also need for them to succeed.

Which of their needs can you meet?



If you haven't, you now need to notice:

To whom does your work matter most?

This is where your efforts must focus.



There is nothing back there but the past,

And tomorrow's always a day out of grasp.

Today will give you everything you have.



It's time to help them. You're already set.

Anything you feel you haven't finished yet,

Will get done by becoming their advocate.



At least half of this current journey's joy

Is finding that there's nothing to avoid,

That more than half of it is your choice. 



Focusing on the wrong things wins no award,

But there is one thing it's truly priceless for:

It asks you what you're truly working toward.



That deserves your most strident no,

Both, because it won't let you grow

And because it's an unoriginal road.



Isn't it wonderful - to be this original,

To show yourself you're an individual,

To let their effect on you be minimal?



You're overflowing past replete.

What you need is a brief retreat

Until a full recovery is reached.



Your time is priceless.

So sidestep that crisis.

Practice preciseness.



Until you tend to all this entails,

Success is yet another way to fail.

Pay attention to all your details.



Winning at a game not of your choosing

Is simply one less obvious way of losing:

Which game spurs constant improving?



Sitting quietly, you quickly create,

Not just a spark that speculates, but

A brightness that fully illuminates.



Recognizing a pattern makes you responsible

To make your response all the more rational.

Make your reply more measured, less radical.



Understand when you're wasting your time,

When you're working yourself into a grind.

Searching for the cause, what do you find?



What a wonderful place you've reached!

But your journey is far from complete;

This was yet another barrier breached.



You cannot create amidst distractions -

It makes your creations mere reaction.

Go where there are fewer interactions.



If you pick up focus and put down the rest,

Life takes you on the most fulfilling quest:

Do fewer things better, and one thing best.



Even though today feels sunny, nice and warm,

You shouldn't go all the way there to perform.

Be here to weather tomorrow's passing storm.



What's behind those moody explosions?

Well, despite whatever next approaches,

Take responsibility for your emotions.



You are responsible for your state of mind.

You are responsible for how you use time.

You are responsible for staying genuine.



Delay getting emotional about circumstances

So you'll give everyone at least a few chances

To understand exactly where your stance is.



You have limits - and yes- they shift.

Still, let no one, ever, get away with

Putting you where you no longer fit.



Whether via spoken or written word,

Do you feel like you're being heard?

Does something else need to occur?



What you really need is a break.

So then, are you willing to take

Time away for your own sake?



Your emotions are amazing indicators,

But far from articulate communicators.

Trust them to point out manipulators.



A reason to celebrate is coming very soon,

And when it does, regardless of your mood,

Welcome it with those who celebrate you.



Preparation doesn't start the mission,

But it is what makes sure you finish.

So are you packed and ready to begin?



Enough of conversations about the path,

And about what all happened in the past.

Your road awaits you with an "At last!"



This is the point where you say enough

Rummaging through all that same stuff.

What new treasures can you dream up?



Talking about the same things loops

Your life via the words you choose.

To change, talk of something new.



There are things that are undoubtedly true -

But that to speak of provide us nothing new.

Give your conversations an unbiased review.



What would you love to discuss for hours?

What blooms feelings in you like flowers?

What, at first mention, gives you powers?



If you forgot about it, it would stay there.

If you found it, it would still be nowhere.

It is not something to even bother to bear.



Many of your aspects you take for granted

Bestow upon you your greatest advantage;

Blessed whether or not you understand it.



What do you have at stake?

Then leave less up to fate:

Choose the path you take.



Delays, even due to procrastination,

Can actually be quite advantageous:

They wait out newer confirmation.



Too big? Break it down into little pieces

To focus on learning about what each is.

Take on one. You have today to reach it.



Pain makes itself impossible to ignore.

While it would be odd to ask for more,

Where you can bear it, you can explore.



To be the best of all, do the least,

But using a focus that's complete.

You'll be in awe what's unleashed.



Bullies don't want a fight, they want a win.

So fight. Protect yourself. Tuck your chin.

Spot patterns. Find opportunities. Close in.



They need a leader, not a manager.

The tasks? They can handle them.

To lead? Try to understand them.



Though chaos may spread to every little bit,

You don't have to give in or even try to fit:

Perspective changes everything about this.



Ignorance halts your growth.

Discovery lets wisdom show.

Isn't it easier once you know?



You owe your (deepest) thanks to this injury

Since without it, there would be no recovery,

Which is, in fact, a cellular-level improving.



The pain certainly gets your attention,

Becoming the only thing you mention,

Until you face and release the tension.



Not a trunk - be the branches that grow.

Spread outward then upward. Make it so

(To learn is more useful than to know).



What's a tree's branch without its trunk?

It's a vine on whatever it's become clung

(Tend first to foundation, then to fun).



What happens won't decide what you do.

Who you are inside is what will choose.

Character wins where circumstances lose.



Though young at heart, be the adult: Adjust,

Not because you want to - because you must.

It is the steadiest way to earn your own trust.



No, you didn't start.

Still, own your part:

Consult your heart.



You're

Even

More.



If a job well-begun is already half done,

Forget about trying to rush or outrun:

Just find the best detail to confront.



Stop whatever you were doing.

Pause on the path of pursuing.

Schedule something soothing.



Invite someone you truly trust

To silently sit or deeply discuss

All that your heart says you must.



When was the last time you took a breath

Without a care in world what came next?

Well, it's time to (if you have to check).



You belong right here,

Where the air is clear,

And the calm, sincere.



Give yourself permission to stop -

To let all you're shouldering drop,

To go where everyone else is not.



Don't put off your need to relax;

Busyness, more busyness attracts.

Likewise, calm brings calm back.



When you feel this pace needs to slow,

You already know where you could go:

Now you're accountable to make it so.



If you do indeed need to decompress,

What's the best thing you can do next?

(Ask your calendar for a day of rest.)



Where there is an ache, there is a need

For not just intention, but for a deed.

How could you water healing's seed?



It's time to give restlessness a rest,

Reflect on the ways you're blessed,

And decide what you'd enjoy next.



That doesn't have to be your story - ever -

So long as you brave today's brief weather

Knowing tomorrow heads toward better.



That is not what this is for.

There is so much yet in store,

Because in you awaits far more.



If you can enjoy this, just wait:

What's next will deepen the state

That you haven't left up to fate.



It's not some test - not even a quiz.

So stop being the one who analyses.

Your next chapter - that's all this is.



When you need support, give some too.

Help someone reach their breakthrough

(These things tend to arrive in twos).



Just a little further from where you've been

Is where you need to get to stop fitting in -

Which is where your awesomeness can begin.



Notice the breathtaking throughout your day,

Moments that could have gone any other way,

Yet chose you to bear witness that they came.



They'll still be there doing that, so go

Farther and farther down today's road

(In whichever direction they won't).



You won't even need to add anything

Once you shed bad ideas that cling:

Do you realize the light you bring!



You will get there. But when you do,

You'll keep going, straight through:

Your goals have such temporary use.



Do you need them to acknowledge this?

Might that help you - even a little bit?

Just where would their acceptance fit?



Being accepted for what you were

Is similar to being kindly cursed:

Put yesterday's praise to rest first.



Everything is changing, and will do so

Regardless of where you'd prefer it go.

Therefore, a yes works better than a no.



What you've done helps what you'll do:

Today's efforts create tomorrow's news.

Tomorrow is busy putting today to use.



The how is more important than the what,

The striving more important than the stuff,

The more, more important than the enough.



Are you excited only because this is new?

Are you excited because of what it can do?

Are you excited for what time will prove?



Drop the theoretical and the political.

How much you can handle is critical:

Become more tactical than analytical.



Problematic solutions tend to entangle

And then get you improperly anchored:

For a fresh approach, use new language.



Your best ideas may work in isolation.

But once you add life's complications,

You'll most want more collaboration.



What's most exciting about this new way?

Is it the newness of whatever's changed?

Or is it the expansion of your own range?



The foundation of your thing must be sound.

Only then can all your best options abound -

Only then can you build upon what grounds.



What's the point if yours can't cooperate?

Don't leave the details of this up to fate:

How could your work best interoperate?



This is how well you handle things today.

What about when more's added to the fray?

Now to get simultaneous efforts underway.



Pick out one of your friends at random:

Are they trustworthy and open to candor?

How many like them could you handle?



Conflict isn't something you can long afford.

But when you get everyone involved on board,

Consensus ends up becoming its own reward.



What is it you truly want to do?

Not in the distant future - soon.

Where would you need to attune?



Take every shared story as a gift,

A chance for a perspective shift,

A reminder to not be set adrift.



No more discussing yourself abstractly.

What are you looking forward to exactly?

Discuss you yourself defying satisfactory.



Pettiness ends up being far from small

Because of how it can take from us all:

Uphold standards that outstand tall.



Don't let worse scenarios preoccupy.

You can avoid what you can identify.

Now let your focus slowly intensify.



You can address what you can locate;

You can't, what you leave up to fate.

You might do well to sit and wait.



Declutter from within, then all around.

First clarity, then goodness can abound,

And then goodness has room to resound.



Stop doubting. Start knowing.

Stop prepping. Start showing.

Stop stopping. Start going.



Be more interested in people than ideas,

In specific remedies than broad panaceas,

In the actual playing than in the arenas.



The frame you put around a situation affects

Everything - even the very way you reflect -

So try out a few before your choice is set.



You can bear anything that you frame rightly,

But don't frame the situation so tightly that

You can't change your ways ever so slightly.



Heart, mind, body, and soul - how are you?

What has each and every aspect been up to?

Is each one engaged in one something new?



Enjoyment or engagement - you choose which

You want to feel to drive you to the finish.

You'll feel even more of the one you pick.



There is another side of you

That is not one bit less true

That is up to you to choose.



You're equally capable of the opposite,

The precise amount, not approximate.

So, of all your options, be cognizant.



Light makes shadows. Shadows are blocked light.

Whatever feels in the way of you shining bright,

Is necessary to outline what you're doing right.



Your least favorite part is valuable too,

Because by existing, what it does prove

Is that the valuable part is to choose.



Each of your actions makes some sense,

Even the ones that felt like detriment.

Forgive. Let understanding commence.



What you don't understand about yourself

Is that you embody doing poorly and well

And so hold within you the key to health.



There is nothing to resist -

No, not within any of this.

Yes, you know where you fit.



Those you most deeply resist

Reveal something deep within

Waiting to be felt, not fixed.



Despite the mess they may have made,

There are things about you that evade

Balance (because they feel betrayed).



All the things you know about yourself

Are but one book on your library's shelf.

All the yet unknown is what truly helps.



You won't understand - so stop trying;

There is so much more yet underlying

The part of you that is truly undying.



Break the worst cycle immediately,

With an unprecedented expediency

(Follow your best self obediently).



This moment is the only one you control,

The only one whose fate is already known

The moment you make it your new home.



You're not far at all - keep going!

You're so close without knowing

Your strength is finally flowing!



If you can just sustain this pace,

You'll find yourself face to face

With a view atop sheer grace.



This is the kind of pace to maintain

To build momentum enough to sustain

Orbit around a whole new domain.



You know how far you've already come.

Know that's a mere fraction of done.

The rest finishes by you having fun.



Don't think of it as thankless toil.

It's more like water before a boil,

Or a surprise time refuses to spoil.



A little farther is all you need to get

Away from the pull of the past's intent.

You're almost there, a little farther yet.



Part of you embraces, part of you refuses.

Neither is wrong, each simply chooses to

Remind you what its direction produces.



You'll figure it out on your own.

Be patient. Don't rush to be sold

On what they don't actually know.



Before you take on today's endeavor,

Keep in mind the tenets of leverage:

Build upon your best, whatever it is.



What you have done is a great foundation,

So don't start over on your next creation:

Build upon your best past determination.



If you forgot how far you've come,

Recall an adventure - at least one -

That you would now regard as fun.



Your perspective has widened,

Which perhaps coincides with

How much love you've applied.



Don't take that shortcut.

It won't be good enough

(For what's coming up).



And/but what if you're wrong?

Are you still able to get along?

Even if both wills are strong?



They're afraid of the wrong thing,

Which is usually what's occurring

When they forget what you bring.



Things fall apart - that's what they do.

They must, eventually. Time has proof.

Between now and then, mindfully use.



Though time goes by regardless,

Still, wasting it isn't harmless,

Not when it's here to harness.



Your plans don't have to happen exactly -

But they should exist, however abstractly

To remind you to think then act, aptly.



If you find yourself among unhappy folk,

Consider that something in them broke,

And leave before your kindness provokes.



They may not be as willing as you

To embrace any but familiar truth:

They will be best far from view.



Your uniqueness cannot be copied.

Attempts to do so come out sloppy

Because they lack your spirit body.



Anyone can make an attempt.

From failing, no one's exempt.

The trick is to get more adept.



You are so close, you cannot cease.

In fact, let your intensity increase

Before pausing to enjoy some peace.



It's good to try the new and weigh the old.

Experience has much to offer - all it holds.

Meanwhile, newness can feel light yet bold.



Don't plan for obstacles, but do expect some.

They like arriving when you're almost done,

And love leaving when you consider them fun.



If you do that, you'll end up annoyed,

Getting results you'd normally avoid,

So allow that craving to be destroyed.



Build upon your strengths - keep rising

Use yesterday's gains to keep climbing.

Up, up you go, toward higher findings.



Dig deeper into where you're at -

Down into what makes you react,

Down to where feeling fixes fact.



Get yourself out into nature.

Get to it now as well as later.

Get out into what is greater.



Circumstances for which you can't prepare

Are waiting for you literally everywhere -

Until it's you who startles them with care.



Become anything but predictable;

What makes you most irresistible

Is not bothering to be explicable.



The right question is purely creative.

It's investigative, while not invasive.

Its openness alone is very persuasive.



The quality of your questions predicts

Whether a quality answer might stick,

So do a quality check. Make it quick.



Is frustration possible if you're unwilling

To expect your needs can be met by anything

Outside your own unfrustrated wellspring?



What's bothering you can't really

When you think about it tranquilly

Enough to whisper, "How silly."



If you want the plain truth,

Nothing can frustrate you

Once you break through.



The things you claim frustrate,

Could be considered lightweight

Compared to what you've faced.



If you'd categorize it as frustration,

What you need more of is patience,

With yourself, not with a situation.



New circumstances? You'll feel the same

Until you decide everything must change.

You're the only reason anything remains.



That's not be a mood you want to maintain,

So from those triggering triggers refrain,

And also, give your preferred mood a name.



Enough attention on what annoys.

What about what you most enjoy?

Where is your attention poised?



When there's a breach of your standards

You'll find yourself having to demand

Exactly what they need to understand.



Maintain your state. Don't let them rattle

You. Decline their invitation into battle.

Stay in your quietude and let them prattle.



It won't work, because they're outside.

Even if they speak ill or outright lie.

You master you. Take this in stride.



They're in a loop - don't follow along.

Stay unmoved. Above all, remain strong.

This isn't where you ultimately belong.



You cannot be moved if you predetermine.

You cannot be swayed once you're certain.

You cannot be forced to bear their burden.



No matter how many drama raindrops pour,

Their state of mind can't wash away yours

For yours is the one that always endures.



Theirs doesn't have to be the same as yours.

Yours does have to be the kind that endures.

Yours does have to be the one that matures.



They get to express whatever they want.

But you don't get to be so nonchalant,

Not as top-ranked Inner Commandant.



Only so much can come forth at once,

Otherwise your sharpness may blunt.

Imbalance is something to confront.



Test your own thinking against itself:

Apply it to people other than yourself.

Does it serve or suit them just as well?



It should work forward as well as back

If it's going to keep anything on track.

It should be plain, simple, and compact.



Who says you don't know what you're doing?

If no one outside you deserves any proving,

That inner critic could use some ungluing.



Who says you're not the one to do it?

Since there is no worthy outer critic,

Assume the inner one's also a misfit.



Who says you always do that?

Someone busy keeping track.

So contradict their false fact.



It will turn out better than you imagined

Once you let go of whatever has happened.

Let your perspective become unfastened.



There will always be a more imposing pile

Of things to do before you can sit awhile.

But sitting is where you will rise higher.



To emerge from any deep funk,

Take a day on, chunk by chunk

Till thoughts become unthunk.



Nothing's insurmountable

Once you stand accountable

And decide what's allowable.



Nothing can delay you anymore,

Not only because you feel sure -

No, because your intent is pure.



Examine your work. Go over it carefully.

By doing so early, often, and voluntarily

Your results will improve extraordinarily.



By giving in, you may gain more

Than all your total efforts before

(Certainty via becoming unsure).



Lean back onto all your past work

(Why not try it - it couldn't hurt).

What if you asked its advice first?



Infinite options are what you've got

(So don't think yourself into a slot):

You're making a choice, even by not.



There must be a break so you can breathe,

A block of time to find rest and reprieve

That lets the former you politely leave.



Leverage uses what you've already got

To more easily get what you now want,

As a chef turns scraps into soup stock.



At what point are you going to turn around

And appreciate this by looking back down?

Always only climbing simply isn't sound.



It's good to have standards, but relax too.

It's a good way to be outside and review

It all in a way that's unattachedly true.



It's good to be open. Now close for a bit:

What all you have here is a very good fit

For if your efforts ever need to be quick.



It's alright that you prefer to keep going,

But if you do, there's a chance of throwing

Away what you could keep by just slowing.



Just stop and think about your thoughts.

Are they giving you all that they ought?

Which ones need help to get uncaught?



When you finally get yourself to relax,

You can finally get your vitality back.

Until then, you're a train on a track.



If you won't stop of your own volition,

That you had stopped you'll be wishing.

Stop, however you make that decision.



Wake up even more. It's time to get going.

Pick up speed to reverse all that slowing.

You need more momentum, not knowing.



Figure out a schedule that works for you

So you're not some servant it puts to use.

Put your calendar under constant review.



The real point of self-analysis

Isn't to overthink extravagance,

But to prevent looping paralysis.



The purest point of self-reflection

Isn't to preen powers of perception,

But to prevent dire self-deception.



It's almost time for you to rest,

To relax (at least try your best)

Until sleep comes for you next.



This is what it feels like to be... you.

To feel even more of it, just choose.

There's no telling what you can do.



Of course, you think you know.

But of course, you truly don't.

What of this can you control?



What is it you mean?

You're stuck in between,

Despite how it seems.



What was your reason? What is it now?

Did it change all on its own somehow?

What change did the journey endow?



If success might indeed leave clues,

Then why be drawn to shiny or new?

Why not seek what's tried and true?



Tend to your needs before you go tend

To what they themselves should mend.

Against clever impositions do defend.



All you've learned will amount to squat

If you don't apply it to what you've got.

You will learn more just by doing a lot.



You can do this. Guard your stability.

You have equal parts grit and ability.

Your hardest times prove your agility.



It won't do any good to react this time.

They're unwilling or unable to unwind.

You can save yourself from their grind.



Slowly, sweetly, take care of your needs,

Not whittling them down to mere deeds,

But tending them like tomorrow's seeds.



Though your heart begins to race

And heat rushes into your face,

Invite inner peace to overtake.



Of all the things you want to convey,

Which ones are things you should say?

Which can, for now, be tucked away?



Who are you without their chaos?

Who, without stories of betrayal?

Who, without what you take off?



It takes more time than you've dedicated.

Now that you've been informed/educated,

Let it, in your calendar, be demonstrated.



Your friends hint at what's ahead for you

Based on what each of them is now up to.

Does your set of friends need a review?



Your abilities there will eventually wane.

But you know nothing ever stays the same.

Let your view on the whole thing change.



There's no perfect time for self-care,

At least if you ask others what's fair.

Be a bit more selfish and less aware.



You have some ever-changing limits

In your body as well as your spirit.

The next change? You are near it.



Don't jump at their first offer,

Because people do that often -

Rather than so simply soften.



Time is your secret, personal treasure.

But patience is the only way to measure

How much you spend on every endeavor.



If you run out of energy in the moment,

Don't think how you could've known it,

Rather be grateful for being shown it.



Years pass more quickly than you realize,

While moments can feel like forever inside.

Perhaps you're taking the wrong one in stride.



Think about how you think about it.

Where else might this thinking fit?

Do your thoughts about thoughts mix?



The emotions that get attached to it

Are going to make all the difference,

So try to link it to whatever uplifts.



How much of that truly mattered?

How much of it is now in tatters?

How much goodness was gathered?



How much goodness could you gather

If you got to the heart of the matter

And left the trivialities in tatters?



Be careful identifying with that news.

What does any of that say about you?

Feel about it, but break on through.



Wonderful news is exactly that -

But don't go mindlessly attach.

It's wonderful. That's just that.



Celebrate their victories. Honor yours,

Because honor into celebration pours

A universal, yet personal, "Of course!"



Get rid of what you can. Override the rest

By simply taking one clean, erasing breath

And finding something better to do next.



How does that work? Why bother fretting?

Time spent on that is better used in getting

Even a bit better at inwardly interpreting.



It feels good - to reach a plateau -

To realize how high you could go.

Enjoy this, then continue to grow.



It must feel incredible to recall,

That feeling of beholding it all:

Channel that to scale this wall.



No, it is not insurmountable -

Not if you remain accountable

To what you decide's allowable.



What you decide is allowable -

To that you are accountable.

Your gains will be bountiful.



To have results that are bountiful,

Hold only yourself accountable in

How you take on your mountain.



You cannot decide the road for them,

Nor can anyone pick yours ever again.

If you must, reservedly recommend.



What you think and what is true

Will always differ because who

You are is a point of view, too.



If you fully let go, all would benefit

Even if no one dared to mention it.

Can you shift attached to separate?



Once your will is commensurate,

No one will actually mention it -

Yet you will immediately benefit.



What could happen if you develop it

To a level that feels like a better fit?

Success is about expanding benefit.



This is wonderful, and more awaits.

Don't rush, because you're not late.

But there are some benefits to haste.



Feeling bored is one thing, being it another.

One is a passing state, a danger is the other.

By kindling any pursuit, both get smothered.



You can do more. It's the time

To kindle a fire in your mind.

Wait. It will soon burn bright.



Challenge your mind, rather your thoughts.

Question whatever they claim you ought not.

Unlearn what they were unwillingly taught.



What would you consider a good sign?

Something you would easily recognize?

Something you already knew how to find?



What about the unknown parts?

That point back to your heart?

Here is a good place to start.



And here's a good place to start,

Right where you hold your heart,

Your world's most important part.



When you can work from your center,

Everything can become your mentor;

What was closed can ask you to enter.



When your heart becomes your center,

You attract a different kind of mentor

Who causes even more love to enter.



You don't need a mentor

For learning to enter

(You need to center).



Here is that better place to start -

Here where you work with heart -

Where the day is your work of art.



Establish your pace,

Then begin to race

For your own sake.



It won't seem like anything new,

But tiny changes will surprise you

By how much they can add up to.



The reason won't be immediately clear.

And while benefits may already be here,

Over time, it will change how you steer.



What you accomplish in a block of time

Will all other previous benchmarks defy

When you master being inwardly kind.



When you master being inwardly kind,

The best outcome will be a better mind

With a heart that compels it to unwind.



Just like that, you'll begin to master

What you were never able to do faster

Once you depart the land of disaster.



You don't actually have to have an opinion

On which will end up losing or winning.

Over your own balance, hold dominion.



Once you but a process in place,

You'll move at an incredible pace

While leaving nothing to waste.



This isn't yesterday in disguise.

It's a new day, behave likewise,

And you will likely be surprised.



It will take time before benefits arise,

But trust there'll bubbling deep inside

Anything you give yourself to that's wise.



Without changing your day's structure,

Which barriers in it could you rupture

To bring yourself to a better juncture?



You are at a completely different juncture,

Where you'll need a whole new structure -

One that quickly puts the useless asunder.



It's only a few that leave the biggest mark,

That reach the very center of your heart.

Remembering them is where to start.



It's the small number that tips the scale,

The few things that ultimately prevail,

So focus on the most important detail.



The reason to focus on the smallest detail

Is that that's the one worth all the travail

If you truly intend to effectively prevail.



Small efforts create big change,

So try doing it a different way,

And again until success remains.



It's not about grand efforts,

Nor about tiresome tenets.

Do for the very real present.



Certain details decide the whole thing

If only for all the trouble they bring

Left undone (Do them with caring).



You should give, by default,

More attention to the small

That quietly underlies it all.



Measure how much you'll need.

Match that amount. Don't exceed

The level you want guaranteed.



A bit of prudence is wise.

Keep some energy inside.

You'll need in due time.



Mistakes are easier to address

When you give yourself access

To your worst and your best.



Trust your ability to make a decision

Whether or not you're feeling driven.

Decisiveness is the gift you've given.



They'll never know what's best for you

In part, because they'll never have to -

In whole because it's an inner pursuit.



Only you know how close you came

To becoming something the same

As what you refused to be again.



Sometimes you just need the validation,

Not a propped-up, premature celebration,

Someone to simply witness the situation.



If you could just complete one chunk,

The smallest haul of accumulated junk,

It'd yank you out of any kind of funk.



To be so close and not make the attempt?

No - no excuse could classify you exempt.

Yes, you'll always know how far you went.



To have come this far and yet keep going

Past past awarenesses or present knowing

Produces a version of you that's glowing.



You could've known, if you'd inquired.

But sometimes it's best, to stay inspired,

To remain unaware of what's required.



Sometimes the number feels too big.

But before you even think to renege,

Go deep down in yourself, and dig.



This is just a section of a bigger whole.

Tackle it, for your sake, as its very own

Thing that plays an unmistakable role.



In no time, you end up getting so close

Inspiration need not feel so grandiose:

Invite motivation in a day-sized dose.



Whatever you accept needs to be whole,

And not reconstituted in ways untold.

Over your standards you have control.



For things to grow,

What needs to go?

How do you know?



What do you need to purge?

With or without the urge,

A choice needs to emerge.



A decision needs to emerge

Or past ones may converge.

What do you want to occur?



What would you need to occur

For their interests to converge

Yet your outcome to emerge?



Just a few more is what's needed

And then you will have succeeded,

Or at very least fully-completed.



If success equals some nice, round number,

You've made a key consideration blunder:

Will you feel more or less encumbered?



If it's solely about the numbers,

Why not work without slumber?

Rest. In your dreams, go wonder.



For now, your goal's secrecy keep.

Hold your dreams quiet as sleep.

While awake, shepherd the sheep.



They don't mean you any harm.

Selfishness simply lacks charm.

Navigate without being alarmed.



Few actually mean their harm.

They simply haven't disarmed

Their self-interested alarms.



Then it will be something else again

Until you skip to this one's very end

To spot the fray you need to mend.



Could you get it done? Yes, of course!

Must you do it by brute mental force?

No, ask what your heart would endorse.



Of course there's another way. Always is,

Always was, always will be - especially if

You're able not just think, but to feel it.



There's a thing about things in threes

That use focus and balance to increase

The entire thing by countless degrees.



There is a balance about things in pairs

That can extend that balance anywhere:

Even a contrast needs two to compare!



There is a power about there being one -

About a single, solid point of dominion,

The essence of finishing what's begun.



Perhaps there's been enough discussion.

The meal's been overcooked in the oven.

Eating requires no further instruction.



Perhaps there has been enough discussion.

Perhaps there need be no more wondering.

Perhaps you must do what an idea doesn't.



Hold your end of things up.

Do at least what's enough.

You're finally at the cusp.



You're finally at the cusp,

The outer rim of enough,

The inner realm of love.



Do at least what's enough

If you mean to measure up.

To go beyond, simply love.



Are you doing what you love,

Or merely trying to keep up?

Is the heartfelt not enough?



You receive more than enough

When you receive it with love,

Because you breathe abundance.



Why not take just a little longer

So you can grow a bit stronger,

And await life's better offer?



There's only a little bit left,

But don't become obsessed:

Still, go and get your rest.



Though there's so little left to do,

Still, don't rush the breakthrough

Lest your doing loop repeat anew.



Make it easier still

By using finer skill

(And subtler will).



Position yourself in the right place,

In the presence of a moment's grace

(Which tends to be a nature space).



Keep going and there'll be time to rest

Right after you get a chance to check

What's done and what you'll do next.



It won't take an unreal amount of work

To get things how you want them first,

Before getting more deeply immersed.



The outer edge, where you meet everyone,

Is not where you get your inner work done

But it is where you can infuse it with fun.



You can't stop now. It's just not right -

Not when the end is so clearly in sight,

Where you're now guided by its light.



You can choose any direction. Why that?

How much of it feels forward? Any back?

No need to answer, but it had to be asked.



Is there something over there you need?

Or just want without wanting to plead?

Go then, knowing nothing's guaranteed.



The questions you need to answer

Can feel like ones that enhance or

Invite even more love to transfer.



Shouldn't you be done with that already?

Don't you notice how it always unsteadies

When you put the important over the petty?



When it's uncomfortable,

Maintain your wonderful

By staying ungovernable.



Continue to be ungovernable -

Uncontrollable, yet vulnerable,

The wiliest, wisest wonderful.



Could you be this wonderful

Without also being vulnerable?

Congratulations on just it all.



From how much is changing too

It will need to be something new

If it is to safely carry you through.



Opportunity truly begins to open up

When you've kept surpassing enough

For so very long that it must be love.



You've kept doing it for so long

You've become incredibly strong

And recognize where you belong.



You'll recognize where you belong

By where you don't, where's wrong.

You won't be waiting for too long.



What would your ideal tribe be?

Those who would meet all needs

Or help somewhere in between?



What if they met all your needs?

How would that possibly feel?

How much of this wish is real?



That is enough speculation.

Eliminate the complication

By working real situations.



It is not time to let up yet.

Your momentum is nearly set.

There will be time for rest.



Time for you to set a goal

Between realistic and bold

So you can rest, yet grow.



The goal should feel like a stretch,

Like something a bit uncertain yet

To gradually draw out your best.



If you're depending on intensity,

Beware life's little complexities.

Better to count on acting flexibly.



You have a target, and the day has one:

Its gets met by the setting of the sun.

Yours is at the whim of the day's fun.



Be flexible, yet unwavering

Because what you're savoring

Gives your life its flavoring.



Be flexible, yet unwavering,

Detached diligently laboring,

Calmly, steadily hastening.



Tend to your tasks, but mind your map.

Rise above here to find where you're at.

Locating yourself saves you a backtrack.



Of course, there is another way,

But changing course so late today

Is unwise, so on this course stay.



There are chores you have to do,

And others you're free to choose,

As well as ones you can now lose.



The whole point of a daily quota

Isn't to get your cup flowing over,

It's to deprive distraction every iota.



You don't have to know. Live into it.

The how is arriving as a perfect fit.

Your determination determines this.



An intention is something you pledge

To carry out past completion's edge,

So apply your whole self for leverage.



Faith is more than ideas you believe -

It is what fuels the ability to achieve

Beyond what your mind can conceive.



Your imagination is your link

To everything possible to think.

Venture out past curiosity's brink.



Distraction is the enemy

That targets your identity.

Target distraction mentally.



Distraction versus serenity,

Often arrives accidentally,

So proceed intentionally.



You will only attain what you infuse

With the energy that it can then use

To connect you with what next to do.



What then are you planning to do next?

Have others tried? Have you checked?

Study their work like a history subject.



Remain steadfast in the face of opposition,

Dogged in pursuit of your decided mission.

Oppression soon surrenders to ambition.



Beware throwing around too many labels

Because whether you are willing or able,

By deeds, not words, is life made stable.



It doesn't matter - that's external.

And don't fall for any role-reversal,

Or anything leading you in a circle.



You're accountable to what you already know,

Accountable to all your years of past growth,

And to the pitfalls - yes, especially to those.



Pick up from right where you left off,

Not far behind, way ahead, or across.

When you do, you'll remember a lot.



You don't get to lose so much ground

Over something so predictably down.

Start over based on nothing profound.



If you're so interested in the external,

Your preferred path is a perfect circle.

A straighter road for you is internal.



Labels end up being a tricker way

To feel progress, but actually stay

In one place: Free of terms, stray.



You can swear this is the last one.

But proof lies in when it's done,

Just who you will have become.



What's worse - to wander without a map,

Or collect them just to keep them intact?

What's best? Move from where you're at.



What's left to be gained discussing?

Beyond words? Absolutely nothing.

It is time to commence becoming.



How many different ways can you remind

Yourself to live by your very own design?

As many as your attention is so inclined.



You can't keep stopping to measure,

Nor pausing to count your treasure:

On your focus, exert more pressure.



It's formidable - that much is a given

Fact. So how about how you're living?

How do you make fitting decisions?



Start here: What do you wish to gain?

Next: What are you willing to change?

Then: Which you will you let remain?



When you ask for help from the unhealthy,

The advice you get will make you wealthy

In what not to do (Truth isn't stealthy).



Straightforward yet gentle

Is how to be instrumental

And not merely incidental.



There's a lot to do to get better.

Follow every rule to the letter.

Learn from every single error.



There is more to do to improve.

Work until you find your groove

(Which works bad habits loose).



Once in awhile, you feel a malaise

That's easy enough to blame away.

The trick is to refuse to complain.



It can be so tempting to blurt

Something guaranteed to hurt

(But do something else first).



Be patient enough to find the pattern

To match for better results to happen

And for your effort curve to flatten.



Be patient enough to await your stride.

It is on its way - so long as you comply

With what success in this area requires.



It is not so elusive when you examine:

The best ways to get there all began in

A place of purpose more than planning.



Take a break and then come back.

Loosen up, and enjoy some slack.

For some time, forget how to act.



What bothers you most about that

May be what you keep here, intact

But know you need to give back.



What annoys you most about that

Is what you know you hold back,

What you know you must unpack.



What irks you most about that

Is what you conveniently attack

Outside rather than inwardly act.



Keep your approach simple in order to

Know the difference - false from true

And revisit what you've misconstrued.



You were sure it couldn't be that simple.

Yet it is, because what starts as a ripple,

Simply asks that your start be nimble.



When your actions are nimble,

Their effect is that of a ripple,

An ever-reverberating symbol.



Keep track of all of your resources

For in a bind, your best recourse is

Who you can trust, of course it is.



What you understood and now understand

Are both comparable to tiny grains of sand

Along the shore of you admitting, "I am."



If the wheel, wonderful invention,

Was more necessity than intention,

Meet the need you're free to mention.



What's the point if you don't look back

On what worked, on where you slacked?

There's a bunch you'd do well to unpack.



Go to the edge of what you know.

That is where your next will grow

And where your busyness will slow.



You think you know your own limit,

But you don't until you get near it,

So go where your comfort prohibits.



Time forges fools and sages -

Not from who writes more pages,

But from who deeply engages.



How have you been spending time recently?

Would you consider this spending decently?

What things did you do most frequently?



You'll know when that's enough -

When excuses begin to run rough,

When you're done with that stuff.



Briefly with whatever you convey

Because attentions have a way

Of wandering wildly astray.



Take your time conveying your point,

Letting no one's distractibility annoy;

Figure out what tactics you can deploy.



Things will rise, and things will fall.

If you get easily distracted by it all,

On your own widest perspective call.



Literally or symbolically, leave.

From a distance, you'll perceive

What your return will conceive.



If you have no more to convey,

In a welcoming silence remain

Until inspiration comes again.



Extend everyone a sense of mercy.

Not knowing how they're hurting,

Ease your part of their journey.



Of the great habits that keep you well,

Which ones if you feel ill, also help?

These are ones to be highly upheld.



On the road back to well

Lie things that don't help

So check in with yourself.



It could all make sense -

Even the ill they meant -

But not at your expense.



If you freed this thing of its backstory,

Would it basically steal its inventory?

(Then stop buying yesterday's glory).



You need a literal or figurative soak,

A dunking of your being as a whole

To receive what immersion invokes.



If you can add on a system to it,

You'll slowly increase your limit

Through the attention you give it.



Finding yourself deep in the wrong thing

Has an equal - though opposite - blessing:

The secret to every direction is noticing.



Get it out of your world, out of your home,

Out of anywhere you're with yourself alone.

What works, and doesn't, for you is known.



As you let it go, stay empty awhile.

Don't simply swap a heap for a pile

(Make minimalism today's style).



If success leaves clues,

Then failure must too.

Find what you choose.



What you seek you will find -

So focus toward peace of mind

And things that keep you kind.



There's another way to consider this:

It's something that just no longer fits,

Something that's slowly lost its grip.



Loosen up your tightened grip

On things that no longer fit

(You need to tend to this).



Measure your own mind's grip

And your control over this.

Is each one a natural fit?



Whatever no longer fits,

No longer needs your grip

(Yes, time to let go of it).



Does that idea still fit?

The same way as this?

Can you ease your grip?



Let go because of this:

How, within today's grip,

Can any tomorrow fit?



When dealing with your own mind,

What can be the hardest to redefine

Is who you are when they're unkind.



When negotiating with your own mind,

It will be wisest to be gentle and kind

So you can get it to voluntarily unwind.



Whatever you wish to redefine,

You have to first try to unwind

Right there within your mind.



It is critical for you to redefine

What's happening in your mind

So you can heal from the inside.



Just by choosing to be kind,

You reprogram your insides,

Beginning with your mind.



It wasn't intended to be unkind -

They simply lack control of mind,

Silently suffering deep inside.



Arguing from this or that side

Is a misuse of your mighty mind,

And a waste of your heart's time.



Claiming things are fine

If they are not, inside,

Is to yourself, unkind.



Realize when you're running low

On what it is that helps you glow

Return to where it gets bestowed.



Realize when you're running low.

Recognize where more's bestowed.

Reenergize what makes you glow.



It's on its way to help you grow.

It's coming - don't wait though

(In fact, forget you even know).



Something is about to be bestowed

To you on behalf of those you know.

Use it to help remind them to grow.



Have you ever felt as if you glow?

When you enjoy yourself you do so

(And now you can never unknow).



The reason it's so important to glow

Is that darkness can't help but grow

Without light like yours, you know.



If you don't start soon, that door shuts.

Then waiting goes from maybe to must.

Then you'll feel you've waited enough.



Regarding doors you need to shut,

Not even a good reason is enough:

To grow in skill, you simply must.



You seem close to declaring, "Enough."

Your maybe seems to have made a must.

You seem to be ready to inwardly trust.



What will it take for you to trust

Your own ability to think enough

Of yourself to turn maybe to must?



On the issue of trust -

Not maybe - you must

Share when it's tough.



This time, that is enough.

No more maybe - you must

Decide who you can trust.



Recognize what's been going on.

Don't pretend that you're strong.

Realize you have been all along.



Realize what's been going on

(And that it has been along)

While you remained strong.



Recognize you're already strong

Enough to not give in / go along

With what seems to be going on.



What do you consider strong?

Someone who rights a wrong?

Haven't you been this all along?



There is more to getting along

Than enabling them to carry on:

How much of it, for you, is wrong?



Where've they helped you move along,

Rather than just letting you carry on?

Good friends are who keep you strong.



Managed time makes a mighty locus:

Make your plan, for the sake of focus

(Magic is made without hocus pocus).



If you keep returning to the same locus,

The benefit that you're going to notice

Is that you have gained masterful focus.



To have magic without hocus pocus, 

Gather your energy into one locus,

And vanish your time into focus.



Disbelieve their hocus pocus

Trust in hard work and focus.

Things will change. Notice.



The point of a plan is to focus.

The point of action is one locus.

The point of pause is to notice.



Be extremely mindful where you focus.

It will end you up in the wrong locus.

Check where you are now. Take notice.



Give yourself a little praise

In as many loving little ways

For reaching this latest phase.



Give yourself a lot more praise

Because you withstood, unfazed

Even when the stakes got raised.



Do not be fazed

By jarring ways:

Your guard, raise.



To remain unfazed

When tempers raise

Is worthy of praise.



You have a special way

Of remaining unfazed

(Despite their praise).



There is a better way,

Of accepting praise,

Yet working unfazed.



Grow better at detecting sincerity,

Even in those who have familiarity.

Where do you notice irregularity?



Taking advantage of familiarity

Can pave the way for insincerity:

Be vigilant for any irregularity.



When their supposed sincerity

Takes on a certain irregularity,

Immediately get yourself clarity.



Anyone who leverages their familiarity

To suggest something with regularity

Brings into question their sincerity.



Whatever you experience with regularity

Deserves to be examined for sincerity:

Is it taking advantage of familiarity?



If it happens with irregularity,

Yet leverages your familiarity,

Sincerely question its sincerity.



You're going to need more resilience

When meeting with former affiliates;

Of their intentions, become curious.



Part of better resilience

Is in becoming curious

About your experience.



Who among your affiliates

Improves your resilience?

Of this be more curious.



Who among your affiliates

Loves when you're curious?

Tell them your experience.



It's more fun to be curious

With inquisitive affiliates

Who share your resilience.



Can you remain curious

Without some resilience

Or likeminded affiliates?



Does their question feel sincere?

Is there some motive more severe?

Make openness briefly disappear.



If you feel the question is sincere,

Let your answer be soft, not severe,

And let all guardedness disappear.



With some, you must be more severe,

Letting the warmth briefly disappear

So that you can be strong, yet sincere.



If there is a point to being severe,

It is to force softness to disappear

In the inner space of a new sincere.



Do you feel as if you disappear

When others become insincere?

Let these feelings feel severe.



What do you notice disappears

The moment you are sincere -

What is soft or what's severe?



What you encourage yourself to pursue

Will end up becoming what you accrue.

Will you one day wish you withdrew?



Part of you yet wants to pursue,

And part wishes you withdrew.

What would you ideally accrue?



It's finally time that you withdrew

From what you've tended to pursue

(What peace has chasing accrued?).



Sincerity is the loveliest gift

You give. Immediately uplift

With one simple mood shift.



Their offering is allowed to be unfair.

Take it as balance offering you a dare:

Is it time to be kind or to compare?



When you always do your best,

You will have earned your rest,

Being humbled and/or blessed.



What you kick farther down the road

Will eventually increase your load.

Why not handle what's your own?



Without giving things a label,

Be kind as often as you're able

(Giving love keeps you stable).



Without bothering with labels,

Find when you feel most stable

And deepen how you are able.



You realize how much you're able

To help others become more stable

By dropping all of your old labels.



Do you know how well you're able

To free others from unfit labels?

Your boat makes others' stable.



It is a blessing, to feel stable,

Beyond what any words label.

To do this, you're already able.



You've reached a point that's stable

Enough to guarantee you'll be able

To give yourself a whole new label.



If you don't take the time,

To review within your mind,

How would that be wise?



If you don't spend time

To pause and/or rewind,

How will you be wise?



Where you don't devote time

Is where you'll tend to find

Things you've left behind.



Do you feel compelled

To do extremely well?

What's been withheld?



Sometimes, from what's withheld,

You end up feeling more compelled

To decide on doing extremely well.



Of the many things you need,

The most important is sleep

If only for the sake of dreams.



If it's more ideas you seek,

Go and get them in your sleep:

Deeper you go, better you dream.



That is not what you need.

What you need is more sleep

To rejuvenate as well as dream.



You'll gain more than rest from sleep.

You'll gain more from sleep than dreams.

You'll gain more from dreams than you keep.



A trickster also uses kindness,

Which can serve to remind us

That we also need uprightness.



Living always on guard,

Or letting life feel hard,

Leads away, not beyond.



Of the things you should disregard,

One is that this is meant to be hard:

Your choice is what's truly in charge.



Remember that you're in charge.

You decide what deserves regard

And what it's time to discard.



And with regard to

What to discard too,

Don't try hard to.



The rest of them haven't arrived yet.

Everyone you need has all been set.

Everyone you need is who you'll get.



How long this can take

Is less a matter of fate,

Than just feeling great.



Take better care of your feelings,

Whether or not they're appealing.

They're onto something revealing.



What you've been revealing

By honoring your feelings

Is: You're truly healing.



You know you're healing when

You honor all your feelings, and

You let your lofty theories land.



Most old thoughts are torn and tattered.

Most new ones are unproductive chatter.

Most important are thoughts that matter.



Think on things that matter,

Not in ways that scatter, but

In ways that climb a ladder.



When your attention begins to scatter,

Put it back onto what actually matters,

Onto the state of being you are after.



Which of your thoughts will matter

Long after the commentators scatter?

Ones about peacefulness, not patterns.



Whenever your thoughts begin to scatter,

Notice which feelings precede the pattern:

Focus on having the feelings you'd rather.



Choose which kind of day you would rather -

One sifting footlong strands of idle chatter,

Or one inching toward what truly matters?



The energy generated via conversation

Needn't be fueled by higher education,

Yet turns your inner wheels of creation.



There is only so much you can endure,

And therefore, you shouldn't be so sure

That your need for a break is premature.



Training grants no guarantee of fact

That they know how to, or will, act.

All any moment asks is that you adapt.



When this changes, how will you react?

Will you thoughtfully, gracefully adapt?

Will you keep your requirements compact?



For this journey, keep your luggage compact

So that when a situation requires you to act,

You're able to do so with nothing held back.



What's this sudden need to react?

Did something get you off track?

Remember, you're able to adapt.



By keeping your baggage compact,

When there is wind at your back,

You'll get where you're going fast.



If you don't have access to the facts,

You're still free from feeling trapped.

There's another way to know: Adapt.



Instead of feeling trapped,

Imagine that you're compact

Enough to escape and react.



No situation can have you trapped

If only because you now know that

You're guided by an internal map.



You need to make a general map

To have a sense where you're at,

Whether you go forward or back.



Interestingly often,

Is that the problem

Is too many options.



Go over all your options.

Veto ones with problems:

You need only solve one.



Limit your own options

Taking on this problem.

Work up from the bottom.



You should start at the bottom

Where the root of the problem

Holds solutions. Want some?



Start where you start, but finish.

Incompletedness tends to diminish

Things you then need to replenish.



The things that don't diminish

Are the things that you replenish

Before they're empty or finished.



It can't be denied -

All that you've tried.

What's left? Rise.



The moment you've had enough

Rummaging through that stuff

Is also known as rising above.



That story doesn't have to be false

For its retelling to come to a halt.

Throw it out of your mind's vault.



What to throw out of your mind's vault?

Things that fixate on you being the fault

For forgiveness is the stronger thought.



Don't underestimate negativity's power,

Nor should you rail against it for hours:

Get a view atop your positivity's tower.



Notice if/when they switch characters

Or take some similar, dramatic turn.

Keep your distance, or you'll learn.



Every option is yet possible.

However, you're responsible

(So do something logical).



By holding yourself responsible,

You expand what will be possible

(Accountability is unstoppable).



What's going to be possible

Isn't a notch past probable:

It's you being phenomenal.



You can only do that so many times

Before it's predictable as a rhyme.

Make something of a different kind.



Be ready for each new one you meet,

Because everyone you'll get to greet

Will make you ever more complete.



Your soul dares you to dive deep.

Your self dares you to fly steep.

Your life's truth is in between.



You have a heart, a mind, a soul,

And a body hinting at the whole,

Yet your limits remain unknown.



There are aspects to your self

That hold happiness and health

And parts that defy life itself.



Your ability to wait,

An extraordinary trait,

Will make you great.



Almost is not enough,

So get rid of that stuff.

It needs to be sloughed.



Avoid what everyone else thinks,

Because you're the one at the brink

Where the difference is distinct.



You can't prepare for every situation;

All you can do is take the invitation

To mix experience with imagination.



Mix experience with imagination

And what you get is an invitation

To welcome any sort of situation.



Are you waiting for an invitation?

You have one via your imagination.

Now take control of the situation.



Fixing something that isn't broken

Is closing a door that never opened:

Figure out who wishes to be woken.



The moment you're not sedentary,

You're moving along some trajectory:

Are you the reason, or an accessory?



Be the reason, not an accessory,

For why you're on this trajectory.

Be anything today, but sedentary.



The moment you're no longer sedentary,

You could be the reason, or an accessory.

Are you controlling your own trajectory?



You're on a trajectory,

So far from sedentary,

Yet already exemplary.



Imagining, reminiscing, and noticing

Are your own personal time machine:

Travel forward, back, or in between.



Past, present, future - where's your serene?

You can use your mind like a time machine

To take yourself here, there, or in between.



Do you feel like you're caught in between

Issues of past, present, and the yet to be?

The best thing to do is just keep noticing.



Carve out time for yourself, time to rest,

Time to devote to others, time to reflect.

Time you don't take is time you don't get.



Have you learned more, or is this a loop?

If it is indeed offering you nothing new,

Then there is only one thing left to do.



If it keeps happening, seek a source.

If it's predictable, say, "Of course!"

If it's movable, use controlled force.



Nothing is gained when you fight.

It becomes harder to share right,

And easier to forgo what's light.



Recognize the light

Shining as your life

Let it grow bright.



Be proud of what you've done,

Be open to name the work fun,

Be as new as when you'd begun.



What you call your life

Is in fact, a ray of light

Growing forever bright.



That is fantastic news,

But don't let it confuse:

Get updates you can use.



Don't let the noise confuse.

There's no need for the news.

Quiet is one powerful tool.



Your pause is a powerful tool,

Because while expressing, you

Choose when the world resumes.



Stop in the middle of it - pause.

For no other reason than because

Powerful is the one who withdraws.



Right in the middle, take a breath.

Right then, who knows what's next?

Right when you pause, time rests.



By controlling yourself, by pausing,

You can also stop whatever is causing

Harmony's temporary withdrawing.



Take a moment in the middle of it

To forget the complex riddle of it

To take time, even a little nugget.



There is power in your pause.

The reason to use it? Because

It's as validating as applause.



Rather than waiting for their applause,

You should probably just take a pause,

So that you decide when it withdraws.



If you pause, you'll grow perspective

On what all that momentum intended

By tempting you to not get a breath in.



Now, take a pause -

If only because even

The tide withdraws.



The moment after you pause,

You may realize their cause

And decide who withdraws.



There are moments you should interrupt

(One of them may have just popped up),

So hurry. Without a set plan, obstruct.



It may be time to interrupt

Processes that may construct

Openings that can't be shut.



You may be the only one who will interrupt,

To boldly declare that something's corrupt.

When it's time to be courageous, you must.



The time will come - when you must

Be the one to courageously interrupt

And if ignored, respectfully obstruct.



When you interrupt,

You rightly obstruct

Imbalance built up.



The way to interrupt

Without ruffling up

Is to help construct.



You can interrupt without offending.

Interrupt like a stitch for mending

(Interrupt so they end up lending).



Have you understood their side?

Enough to call some of it wise?

Enough your faults to realize?



Are you understanding their side?

Have you surrendered your pride?

Are your mind's arms open wide?



Are you feeling what they express?

Do you empathize with them yet?

Can you give up wanting to get?



What might they need, over there?

It's good to know whether you care,

For your own sake, for what's fair.



What might they need, over there?

Ask yourself how much you care, as

Well as how much you believe in fair.



What might they need, over there?

If you can't help make things fair,

Then yet greater is simply to care.



What might they need, over there?

Who around you is already aware?

How much do you need to prepare?



What might they need, over there?

What if you looked here to compare?

What meeting of needs would be fair?



What might they need, over there?

Should you answer, should you dare?

Should we ask them? Isn't that rare?



What might they need, over there?

Beyond the things you can compare,

What could give them more than care?



What might they need, over there?

Who do they unnerve, rile, scare?

Which ones need to become aware?



Does that emotion deserve your action?

Would that give it complete satisfaction?

Or would it grow entitled, given traction?



Does that emotion deserve an action?

Will more attention give it traction

To be every inner picture's caption?



Does that emotion deserve more action?

Or should it be treated as one fraction of

What makes up this human contraption?



Does that emotion deserve more actions?

Or are existing ones begging retraction?

It takes as much addition as subtraction.



Does that emotion deserve any action?

Or should you wait out its hasty passion

Until it's truly time for what happens?



Before being left to handle what happens,

You should take into account the actions

And what it would take to cool passions.



Does that emotion deserve inaction?

Has it previously leveraged passion

And left you to handle what happens?



Does that emotion deserve some action?

Do you unleash not all, but a fraction?

Do you think about what might happen?



Does that emotion deserve inaction?

Or perhaps maybe a small fraction?

How do you divide up such passion?



Does that emotion deserve such action?

Perhaps far less - or at most a fraction -

Could get the same outcome to happen.



While you can't know what'll happen,

You can control your level of passion

And deprive that emotion of action.



Whether an emotion deserves action

Depends on what's already happened.

The time may have passed for passion.



Would you rather feel angry or clear,

Searching aimlessly or already near,

Intermittently there or always here?



Would you rather be entangled or at peace,

Getting raging battles to start or to cease,

Gaining the most or demanding the least?



Are you asking yourself better questions?

Or reacting to what needs more attention?

What's more effective in easing tension?



Are you asking yourself better questions?

Or asking others you've read mentioned?

Coming up with your own is always best.



Are you examining your own intentions?

Are you thinking thoughts worth mention?

Are you asking yourself better questions?



Are you following their conventions?

Are you doing what others mentioned?

Are you examining your own intentions?



How seriously you take what they mention

Affects the quality of your own questions

About the nature of your own intentions.



How seriously you take what they mention

Can seriously affect your own intentions,

So get better at asking deeper questions.



There is more power in one great question

Than the sum of all your prior intentions.

Thus, give curiosity more than a mention.



Ask yourself a deep question -

One about your true intention

Before taking any suggestions.



Don't keep making these appeals.

Only you can know how you feel,

And know what response is ideal.



No, you didn't follow to the letter.

But forgive yourself and remember:

When you know better, you do better.



No matter how it seems in this endeavor,

Things align to get progressively better.

You will see, when there's less pressure.



When you know better, you do better.

So next time you're under pressure,

Know you can orient to your center.



You do more to and less for yourself

When you are the farthest from well.

More for and less to lead to health.



Do less to and more for yourself

And you'll enjoy greater health

(Than you may have ever felt).



Do you remember how you felt

When you did more for yourself?

Let's not wait for anyone else.



There are several keys to health:

Do less to and more for yourself,

And don't wait for someone else.



What are your feelings about wealth?

Are they ones forged by someone else?

Are they ones you have made yourself?



Your ideas of health, wealth, and self -

Are they ones created by someone else?

Are they ones you have made yourself?



You keep asking then saying, "Of course,"

As if you forgot that you are the source,

Which is a truth you need to reinforce.



The right question holds a special place

For its ability to create inner space, and

Let you lead the way through with grace.



One way or another, you'll find answers,

Because the way that knowledge transfers

Is through experiences that enhance us.



Experiences that enhance

Are your very best chance

To feel life's vast expanse.



To feel life's grand expanse,

Take every available chance

To do whatever today grants.



You don't have to have a feeling about it

Or to even figure out how/where it fits:

You have to have a good emotional mix.



Regardless of where you may roam,

Your adventures all lead back home,

To yourself. Oh, how you've grown!



Someone even just beside you

Can't perceive just what you do.

It doesn't matter. Just continue.



They can't perceive what you may,

But rather than stop to explain,

Don't bother to incur that delay.



This may be the time to stop and explain

How you achieved what you've attained

(Don't expect them to stop and change).



What do you mean by that?

Is it based on some fact?

Or something less exact?



What do you mean by that?

What does your idea lack?

Who else could it impact?



What do you mean by that?

Could you be less abstract?

Would it still be intact?



What do you mean by that?

How long has this idea sat?

Is it where you're now at?



How do you know?

Were you shown?

Did it just flow?



Even if you guided with examples,

Those critics still couldn't handle

Your journey in a way this ample.



Have you considered the other dimensions

Beyond what anyone currently mentions,

What are other possible consequences?



What is the other side to that?

What might they answer back?

Which one lands more impact?



If you care to be reflective,

What's the other perspective?

Knowing is more effective.



What might their perspective be?

Guessing isn't much of a mystery.

Finding out just takes curiosity.



What makes your question important?

Will an answer lay out an assortment?

Will it get your journey shortened?



Why is your question so important?

Will its answer be your informant?

Does your truth seek reinforcement?



How are those two things alike?

How does each one exist despite?

How could they, together, arise?



Who might benefit most

From such a diagnosis?

Is the possibility remote?



Who might benefit most from that?

Who could it most greatly impact?

Whose ways would remain intact?



Where would most of the benefit go?

How would that help all else grow?

What would it look like as a flow?



The importance of your question

Isn't that answers get mentioned:

Asking reveals your own intention.



Ask yourself why you ask,

Not as some circular task,

But to all things unmask.



Ask yourself why you're asking

And you'll begin the unmasking

Of your inner tricksters basking.



Ask yourself more about your questions,

About your general, everyday intentions

And truly listen (without suggestions).



Do those answers create more curiosity

About what the deeper facts could be?

Nothing is what it at first may seem.



The quality of your questions is crucial.

Flimsy questions accept flimsy approval.

Questions, to themselves, must be brutal.



The quality of your questions is crucial,

Because your answers will serve as fuel

To take you where you find most useful.



The quality of your questions is critical.

Good questions try to avoid being typical.

Great ones materialize the nonphysical.



Better questions are the key

To finding a better way to be

By bettering your curiosity.



Better questions should be your wish.

Better questions the nonsense dismiss.

Better questions are how you flourish.



Taking a deeper dive into what you ask

Also questions the point of your tasks.

Questions cause and effect your impact.



Where can you draw a parallels between

Yesterday and what appears to now be?

Which ones feel most illuminating?



Are you interested or just curious?

Is it a nice possibility or a must?

Are you moving, no matter what?



Is this a no matter what?

Or a just a bit curious?

Know? Yes, you must.



As purpose eventually sheds all its goals,

You grow legendary, not numerically old

(Not the story's teller - you're its hero).



There's a bit more to do,

That at first may confuse.

But you'll soon improve.



You won't have clarity until you dare

To transfer your perspective over there,

Which shows clarity how much you care.



Allow, no, invite them to express

All they want or need to confess.

To have their trust, feel blessed.



Even times when their perspective annoys

For all the self-centeredness it employs,

You be what develops, not what destroys.



You can deconstruct yet not destroy

Arguments that irk or deeply annoy.

It's mental exercise you will enjoy.



That which annoys you, implores

You to go deeper all the more

To what's not so easily adored.



If one person holds infinite views,

That more than doubles with two,

So be patient while they choose.



If you can follow along,

They'll feel you belong,

And won't be withdrawn.



You may need to split

From what won't fit

(Stay away from it).



Limits aren't always things you can control.

Often, it's when you're past uncomfortable

That things begin to become unbelievable.



Even once your standards are set,

Sometimes, you get what you get.

Try not to let this get you upset.



You should notice how many inputs

It takes before you become hooked

Into a net with more than is good.



When you lose more than you planned,

You gain more than you yet understand.

Count your blessings. Subtract demands.



When you're busy making demands,

You're much less able to understand

The world beyond your own plans.



Of the feelings you find legitimate,

Which ones feel potentially infinite

In the direction of your magnificent?



You're going to be presented with

Ideas that have nowhere else to fit

Until you have them and commit.



Their negative potentiality pales to yours.

Your positive potential is what they're for.

They're reminding you to be more mature.



Their destructiveness pales to yours,

And constructiveness? You have more,

So cease festering: You are the cure.



Based on where you've been before,

Their intensity still pales to yours,

So you need to be the more mature.



Do you realize your own genius?

Or are you remaining heedless?

Ignoring your gifts is needless.



Using the word genius

Puts space between us

Making itself needless.



Creativity's finest invention is you.

Long before you do set out to prove,

You're the way its energy can move.



Wisdom is just another word

Until you study life's turns

And a true education earn.



It can't work until you try

A way with no reason why

That serves mostly to defy.



Using so many words

Often only confirms

You need to observe.



Your greatest ideas don't deserve

To be wrapped in so many words.

Try using the most potent terms.



Avoid sipping soup made of words,

Or drinking down cupfuls of terms.

Gain deeper understanding first.



When you find out for yourself first,

You're not misled by curving words,

Nor hoodwinked by swerving terms.



There are heaps and heaps of words,

And piles upon piles of fancy terms

For what from experience you learn.



Not to discredit all the official terms,

Nor to discount any of the fancy words,

But nothing matches experiencing, first.



More than all preexisting words or

Tomorrow's patchwork of terms

Is what your experience is worth.



The trust you total up in terms,

The wishes you will with words -

Don't forget to feel things first.



Don't let your plan be too abstract.

That can also throw you off track,

As badly as fixating yourself to fact.



Come out from behind the abstract.

Meet your day where it's actually at.

Once here, you can get back to that.



The dangerous thing about words

Isn't who or what they can hurt,

It's when they go jump in first.



There is a magic when using words

That can create via the use of terms

And instantaneously build it first.



Just be careful when using words,

Not to forget they're just terms

And that intention comes first.



When you put away the declarations,

You can bring out your aspirations

And put real things into operation.



What you declare finishes in words,

What you do gets itself done first:

When will you be done with terms?



You still have a bunch left to do.

The best way to help yourself to

Is to find a better way through.



Where the welcome doesn't feel warm,

Don't you keep lingering for too long.

Great places feel right - the rest, wrong.



Are you thinking about the right things?

When you don't, what trouble that brings.

When you do, feelings are also benefitting.



The things you let upset,

Won't be a problem, yet

Undue time, they get.



Are you thinking about the right part?

To find out, why not ask your heart?

How you're feeling is a great start.



Are you thinking about the right one?

Or about the part best left undone?

Is any part of this thinking fun?



Focusing any of your thoughts

Anywhere but where you ought

Is where you will get caught.



Can you control any piece of that?

If so, keep your attention attached.

If not, pull all your attention back.



Frustrating, you needn't be frustrated.

Aggravating, you needn't be aggravated.

May your need to react feel overrated.



Once your need to react feels overrated,

Aggravation won't get you aggravated, nor

Will the frustrating get you frustrated.



Reacting means you like to lack control.

Love your inner sovereignty by taking hold

Of every state or mood you call your own.



There's only so much you can squeeze

Out of your own daily well of ease,

So be more mindful, if you please.



When there are needs we fail to fill,

Our bodies warn us via feeling ill -

So this pace will only work until...



How far will you go without rest,

Claiming you're doing your best?

Put what you know to some tests.



Put what you know to some tests.

Are your assumptions still best?

Which ones are to be laid to rest?



To make such a big deal,

Such a heartfelt appeal,

May mean this is real.



There are so many roads you could take,

With each leading to a different place.

This one is lined with the most grace.



There are so many paths to have taken.

You braved any fear of being forsaken

And took this one in order to awaken.



Of all the paths you could have chosen,

You took the one this vulnerably open.

You're living proof of the power of hope.



Of all the ways you could have traveled,

You chose the one that nearly unraveled

You. Fear is a thing you simply haven't.



When you make distractions unavailable,

Your concentration becomes unassailable

As you mine inner gems by the pail full.



The chances of your choosing this path

Defy the entirety of probability's math

Unless it chose you - a one and one add.



How else could so much serendipity fit?

As if you must have been chosen for this.

Enough pondering of that. Into the mix!



There are other ways of being right here

That at the moment, will not just appear

Without guarantees that you are sincere.



How have the existing rules worked?

Has creativity been helped or hurt?

Which rules should you break first?



The probability of things going like this

Is so remote it must be serendipity's fix.

No matter what you do, you perfectly fit.



Holding high standards means losing chances

To do things that are now backwards slanted:

Now you can no longer be unduly enchanted.



You're almost there - remain like this.

What you're doing is still the best fit.

The best thing you've done is commit.



The best thing you can do is commit.

That is how you can find another fit

The moment any changes arise in it.



The best approach is to commit

Rather than await a better fit.

Rather change it from within.



Whatever it would feel like to fail

In comparison, would quietly pale

To the thrill of your journey's tale.



The world within you is bigger than outside,

Bigger than what maps and globes comprise.

Isn't that good reason enough to go inside?



There will be time to get to all of it.

Thing by thing, one by one, commit.

This way, there is nothing you'll miss.



Out in the open is where you'll be best.

Out where, distinguishable from the rest,

Others can behold and choose to invest.



You must remember what's possible,

That every raging river is crossable,

When you decide to be unstoppable.



No one can divert the flow but you.

No one can redefine your own truth.

No one can reach where you choose.



You are somewhere new.

If this indeed feels true,

There is some work to do.



Which part of this feels a bit new?

That's the part to focus right into,

Offering up whatever it asks to lose.



Their long party will continue

Regardless of what you choose.

Make your choice in solitude.



Eventually you'll need to come home

To meet the self you've left unknown.

When you do, it'll be easier to grow.



You aren't meant for constant distraction,

For endless simulated versions of action -

But for graceful expansion and contraction.



Breathe from a place beyond willed action,

Disengage from it without dissatisfaction.

Live the flow of expansion and contraction.



Work through it, all by yourself.

Work through your stuff or else.

Work through what you've felt.



Getting rid of them isn't the solution.

Even if emotions cause some confusion,

There's something they've always proven.



Even if emotions cause some confusion,

Getting rid of them isn't the solution.

Ask what their presence wishes proven.



Whether it can or cannot be proven,

Emotions are clearing the confusion,

Building your subconscious solution.



Try not to be that selective

In your focused perspective

(You'll be more effective).



You will become more effective

When you focus your perspective

So become much more receptive.



Emotions are the journey - in full.

Whether they feel foul or beautiful,

Travel to the heart of their good.



Travel to the heart of your goal.

Continue past where the path goes.

Go where no one else controls.



Even if their light suddenly goes out,

You aren't destined to stumble about:

Your inner light beams throughout.



Some things are best to figure out alone.

Then, next time the road will be known

No matter who else you may have in tow.



The people will be what mattered most,

But long after they've also gone home,

What will still keep you engrossed?



Without putting the question out there,

How much are they asking you to bear?

About responsibility, are they as aware?



When the subject keeps veering

Even if by unintended steering,

You need to do some clearing.



It won't take much, if you get started.

You don't need to have a path charted;

The trip begins once you've departed.



Perhaps that needs to have an ending,

So things aren't continually pending,

And your next aims can keep ascending.



With so many little tasks still pending,

Maybe consider bringing it to an ending,

So to other things you can be attending.



If chaos encompasses a space,

Nervous energy has its place:

Calming down ushers in grace.



Now it is time to get rest,

To get the day off your chest,

And surrender to relaxed breath.



Whatever you do, don't get stuck.

Don't get yourself mired in muck.

Angle yourself in one direction: Up.



To avoid finding your momentum stuck,

Angle all your energy and attention up,

And inspiration will soon gift you luck.



Is there one pattern you need to break?

One habit that too many troubles makes?

Tackle it well-knowing it's not too late.



That's not worth your attention,

Barely even worthy of a mention.

Shift into this brighter dimension.



If you would like your momentum

To benefit from a little extension,

Change things around and then some.



Change for its own sake sometimes

Frees you from a habit's confines

So you can, right here, redesign.



Congratulations on getting here.

Despite many temptations to veer,

You did so by remaining sincere.



Despite the many invitations to veer,

What you've done is stayed sincere,

And that is why things are so clear.



When you can stay this sincere,

It becomes extraordinarily clear

That you can have anything here.



By being flexible, you open up

Life's treasure troves of luck -

In anything - you choose what.



It doesn't mean you give up who are.

It means your impact can travel far,

So far, old limits will seem bizarre.



Settle, for now, on what you have

To get it done on your own behalf

With no last-minute thing to grab.



Treat it all as available to use,

Then add it to your set of tools,

But focus most on what you'll do.



The hardest things to figure out

Are where to dive in and be devout

And what to therefore do without.



Among all of the different varieties,

You'll need to sharpen your inquiries

And be blunt about any improprieties.



What are you going to need to make this?

Who will most, and most often, benefit?

How can you get needs and wants to mix?



Make the flow of your day seamless,

As if you were a scheduling genius,

And could make planning needless.



Take a different approach.

Even if being reproached,

Trust that you are so close.



Before the topic is broached,

You can be the one to approach

Everyone you think should know.



It didn't get worse - the price went up.

You now have to do more than enough.

Life is being honest - it does not bluff.



It's real, not any sort of bluff.

Yesterday is not today's enough.

You can do it (you're tough).



More awaits - more than you can imagine,

And when you redirect your own passions,

That's when the truly incredible happens.



If you were able to remain absolutely still,

The world would seem to turn to your will:

If you did less, time would turn to fulfill.



When you sit still, what's still abuzz?

Is it about what could be or what was?

Sit still for the practice, just because.



Who knows what's coming next?

Why bother then, to feel vexed? 

Why not feel extremely blessed?



Being wrong is actually the best sign

That you'll try everything to realign,

Including find out which way's right.



Once you realize you were wrong,

Your position becomes very strong

(Where had right been all along?).



There is a gift in being incorrect -

It sharpens awareness of what's next

And puts things into better context.



When you're wrong and then so realize,

Your ego gets to surrender its disguise,

And your humility gets to become wise.



What if that whole thing starts again?

Will you be able to stop and refrain?

Can you feel your response change?



It won't stop, but you can slow it down

Simply by choosing not to utter a sound.

Whatever happens next could be profound.



Thoughts aren't the enemy, their level is.

So, quiet them down, or raise them to fit

The state of being you feel best within.



On abstract advice versus lived experience,

Each one journeys through the mysterious,

But only one has answers for the curious.



There is so much less left to do

Than what your mind tells you.

This - its lie - can feel so true.



Why you're here is to savor the whole -

Not to cook meals in a kitchen of goals.

Stow the utensils and turn off the stove.



You are here to notice everything,

Not to endlessly, mindlessly bring

Task tributes to imaginary kings.



Resist the urge to competently reply.

Instead, stay speechless. Know why?

To silently restock serenity's supply.



Whatever you resist the urge to say

Is one less thing to get in the way

Of what one moment can convey.



What you refrain from saying

Is one less thing for weighing

On the scale of overexplaining.



Once you run out of interesting things,

Of adventures and backstories to bring,

You will fully savor what's happening.



When you finally realize it's not enough,

You can enjoy the journey minus the stuff

And marvel at how this way isn't as tough.



Regardless of who regards you as astute,

Often times, the best way to contribute

Is to present listening as your tribute.



Put that down and continue with less.

Trust that proceeding without is best,

Or else try it, then regroup, and check.



You'll go through more to emerge with less

Of whatever you thought defined you best

(Clarity is the reward passing such a test).



Congratulations for coming this far.

Where you've reached/where you are

Is today's special, selective seminar.



Of the places you have yet to behold,

None need you to be as brave or bold

As that place within your own soul.



For as long as your focus is external,

Inconveniences will all feel infernal

(Your perspective needs a reversal).



There's part you know and part you don't,

And what you will do and what you won't:

None will hold true once you're engrossed.



This is still safely here -

On a wide ledge of clear:

Leap into being sincere.



This place is perhaps still too tame

For your essence to find full range.

Deeper is where your wild remains.



One hint that you're still too external?

Circumstances keep coming full circle;

Depth travels straight (going internal).



Openness will be your greatest weapon

In the battle to reclaim your attention:

Lay siege to what lacks clear intention.



Let them label you extreme -

Those aren't what they seem

(Better blunt than between).



This is what you're meant to do for now.

If it isn't, what would tell you, and how?

The truth is that doing is what endows.



Doing isn't for the sake of the deed,

Nor is it to prepare you to succeed:

The distraction lets being be freed.



When you get an early start to building,

Even parts of you that seemed unwilling

Begin discovering something fulfilling.



It's all part of a greater mosaic,

Even the parts that feel archaic:

Just a little distance displays it.



It's underway thanks to your effort,

Thanks to braving injury and hurt,

Thanks to mining your own worth.



Often, you have to mine your own worth.

You have to dig deep, enduring the hurt

To reap all the blessings you deserve.



Though it may hurt -

All this long work -

There will be worth.



Pick up some new ideas from old mistakes.

Experience is a bus that never arrives late.

Ride it to talk to every passenger it takes.



What you have is what's available.

Use this and become unassailable.

Your example will become scalable.



Many changes have already happened.

The rest take time, and some passion.

Infuse more depth into each action.



Are you wondering what's moved?

If you knew would you disapprove?

What gets measured gets improved.



Though it might be a lot to include,

Keeping track is what you need to do

(What gets measured gets improved).



You might know, but don't assume.

Get information that you can use:

What gets measured gets improved.



Revisit former assumptions because

Your world is not what it once was.

Everything matters - it truly does,



Causes always leave behind clues,

So it's time for some proper tools:

What gets measured gets improved.



If what gets measured gets improved,

Then there's some work for you to do

To make sure things return to smooth.



If what gets measured gets improved,

What information should be pursued

So your faith in it can be renewed?



Focus on the wrong thing - no reward,

Because that is not what focus is for.

What is your focus is moving toward?



Forget what the forgettable said -

Focus on moving all of this ahead.

Focus on where all of this has led.



Focus on why you're doing this at all.

Your initial reason if you still recall,

Was different and yet is responsible.



Continue with your same sensibilities,

Until you encounter vulnerabilities.

At that point, reconsider activities.



It won't always be this way.

Change the role you've played

To be what's needed today.



This is not the way things will stay,

So any role others had you portray

You would be wise to duly change.



What you clutch too tightly crumples.

Loosen your hold. Smooth out troubles.

Don't even be attached to being humble. 



Don't be too attached to being humble.

Be agile enough to pivot in any trouble

By exercising your adaptation muscle.



There's a mindset you'll need to adopt

To dodge your efforts getting blocked.

Your preferences may be need to swap.



If you can be more agile,

You'll last a longer while:

Go to strong from mild.



Whether the timing is opportune,

You need results now - not soon.

Ensure you're not left marooned.



For this, you may need to rally

Energy for your grand finale;

Find yourself a restful valley.



You have more to offer than you imagine,

Experience woven through with passion

(How often does an exact you happen?).



You have so much to offer us.

Since you do, you simply must

Share all you would entrust.



It's coming, so prepare.

If you're able to, share

So others are also aware.



What are you trying to compare?

How could you factor in the care

You've invested versus over there?



Whether or not you're aware,

It reflects how much you care:

You simply, selflessly shared.



Don't bother lamenting how unfair.

Don't give more energy over there.

Make yours a space beyond compare.



In your stride, you blow right through

Any preconceived notions misconstrued

(The clearing power is in your mood).



Your greatest power is your mood -

It can barricade or break through,

It can freeze or heat up any room.



How are you feeling about it?

What happens for you within

When things go like this?



Are you giving your feelings room?

Do you think them away or attune

Yourself to what they ask to do?



How you're feeling has to be a factor.

Thoughts are unsteady as a lone actor.

They need the lift of love or laughter.



Then how are you feeling? Do you care?

If you do, are you sure you're aware that

Those feelings keep returning you there?



How you're feeling is the difference

Between deep despair and deliverance.

Thus, let your emotions be vigorous.



Nothing defeats like indifference.

You always defeat it with vigorous

Dedication toward magnificence.



Nothing opposes you like indifference.

The way to defeat it is with vigorous

Devotion to your greatest interests.



Can you do it? Of course you can.

Without even making one demand,

You've gotten them to understand.



Will you attain it? If you choose!

Not only is there nothing to lose,

There's more goodness to accrue.



If you choose, it's going to be yours,

Not in the way you've had it before -

But in one that gets you to explore.



Are you aware of being aware?

Aware that you're right there?

So imagine yourself anywhere.



Are you responding or reacting

To each thing that's distracting?

How long should each be lasting?



It's not your fault - all the distractions.

But based on the time each has fractured,

Isn't it time to make something happen?



What you release is that much less to bear,

What you rethink, that much more to beware,

What you retain, just enough to get there.



Fatigue should be taken seriously.

Sleep is for when you feel weary.

Rest will help you awaken clearly.



Don't multitask - do that one thing.

The only thought to think during

Is, "This is all that's occurring."



All of it's possible, just not simultaneously,

Unless you're hurrying around outrageously;

Being the example will work advantageously.



Be an example. Be the leader,

And the wins that feel meager,

Make their sharing even sweeter.



You've done well, let the rest sit

Until tomorrow. Don't think of it

Until then. For today, you quit.



There is a time, each day, to quit.

To decide to no longer think of it

(Work and rest should never mix).



You don't have to be bothered unless

Something in you wants this stress,

To work through its feelings next.



You don't have to be bothered by it.

You could, in fact, be honored by it

(That you were not clobbered by it).



You needn't feel stress unless you wish.

If you don't, declare you are finished:

Think thoughts that make it diminish.



If the stress begins to bother you,

Think - it actually honors you by

Showing how you follow through.



What's drawing your attention there?

Something that makes you feel aware?

Something that reminds you you care?



Even if someone hollered,

You needn't be bothered -

Your resolve remains solid.



Every response is an emotional one,

Even if you decide yours are done -

With emotions, you never have none.



No need to fixate on sustaining joy.

Living in one state is misery's ploy.

A healthy heart braves every void.



Happiness is something you can't destroy,

But there is no point in clinging to joy.

Live the range of emotions - never avoid.



While you're here, have the whole emotion.

Though it bring the immensity of an ocean,

Feel the truth that you're always unbroken.



Dare yourself to go right to the edge.

Ask yourself for an impromptu pledge

To do the improbable to reach the end.



You can shake this state if you wish.

You can change it. Yes, you can shift.

Indeed, the change can be this quick.



A change in emotions can be this quick.

The way there is far from a clever trick:

Feel what you feel and then think on it.



To feel better, seek out the opportunity

Hiding right here in this state of being:

What way out are you just now noticing?



The opportunity is here if you observe.

Being stuck isn't anything you deserve,

So ask what's really found your nerve.



This feeling is a wonderful opportunity

To feel if you'll accept this continuity,

Or will meet this feeling's community.



Though this is just one phase,

How much attention you pay

Selects what gets set ablaze.



It's not imperative - to stay upbeat.

Whether a feeling feels incomplete

It deserves a proper meet and greet.



Don't get fixated on staying upbeat.

The feeling you feel is one to meet.

By doing so, you're more complete.



Find your own balance of feelings

As you live all your day's dealings.

With each one, find yourself being.



Tranquility might not always be yours.

Remember when you lacked it, before?

Do you love borrowing it all the more?



Whether you enjoy it or wish it not to be,

Today's feeling has no lasting guarantee,

So experience whatever it lets you keep.



How many feelings can you hold at once?

With endless arms it would still be one.

Appreciate whatever comes to you thus.



When a feeling moves to the front,

It is requesting to be felt at once.

Please do so before the day is done.



You can have whatever you can feel.

From what you can't, you should reel

Because emotions are a life's meal.



Feel what you're doing or don't continue.

Passionless effort robs from within you

The strength of your emotional sinews.



When there's a feeling that overwhelms,

Travel to several different inner realms

And learn what they do for themselves.



Observe your emotions without judging.

Be in their commotion without budging.

Whatever they do, give them your loving.



Emotions are your strongest ally.

Though they may not answer why,

Their winds always serve to guide.



Controlling your emotions is an art,

A practice not a perfection of heart,

A journey with a daily fresh start.



Loosen your hold

On what you know

And gain control.



What makes you wise

Often wears a disguise

Or comes by surprise.



If they inflate themselves

In order to convince well,

It's somewhat easy to tell.



Who's around them?

That's very well then.

Don't go there again.



Valuable insights come from others,

Not the comfort your own druthers.

Be grateful for what they uncover.



If you are eager to learn more,

Go where you never have before:

Knock on the unknown's door.



If they refuse to share,

Cease from going there,

Or if you do - beware.



Sacrifice your own to

Prioritize the whole:

Love will be shown.



Cultivate what brings people together,

Empathy, compassion, interest, whatever,

Principles that deserve to last forever.



Openness accomplishes, closedness finishes.

Light exposes corners darkness diminishes.

Neither bad - just two different businesses.



It is time to relinquish your hold

On the identity you call your own

To be a part of the greater whole.



Though your mind worldwide may roam,

Where your heart always turns is home

(It can turn anywhere into your own).



Your mind can be expected to wander,

While your heart may tend to ponder

Both can reach from here to beyond.



If your mind ever feels restless,

Go where you feel blessedness

In your thoughts to stress less.



Despite the ruts habits keep grooving,

Imagination is their endless undoing:

Where can you travel without moving?



Who is there across from you?

It's not something to assume

(Freshly, deeply - interview).



Is there something else you're after?

Something besides love and laughter?

What else lasts long enough to matter?



Eventually you'll have to let go,

Or at least lighten your load:

Take this chance to do so.



Either way, the transition will be bumpy,

So promise yourself you won't be grumpy.

To more, every change holds some key.



Believe it when it happens. 

Before that, stay fastened.

Words raise. Time flattens.



This is a perfect time to reconsider

What once may have made you bitter

For what it was also trying to deliver.



Trust the wait;

It's your state

That creates.



Embrace this uncertainty

As time's little courtesy.

Take none of it urgently.



Neither leave nor linger here

Without getting extremely clear

On whether you're being sincere.



Rushing does nothing but make a loop

That brings you back here to regroup

And finally address something acute.



You can navigate straight through noise

By making one simple, serious choice:

Distractions help sharpen, not annoy.



Distractions are never what they seem.

They can't affect in any way extreme,

Except waking you from your routine.



Settle your mind's antsy air.

Don't follow it over there -

Guide it to one single care.



You'll be on your way shortly.

But even more importantly,

Greet the journey warmly.



It's a fantastic new possibility

That may feel like volatility,

But will give you new agility.



You are finally on your way

To your hoped-for space.

May it leave you changed.



Find yourself somewhere new

By the time you are through

(Otherwise, perhaps, redo).



Have you gotten everything yet?

Before you go, you should check.

Why not get all you could get?



Not yet - don't do anything yet.

Don't even go anywhere to check.

Wait until you get what you get.



Light will be shed on the whole matter.

Nothing you do will shine it any faster

(So don't concern yourself until after).



Quickly now, if you can speed things up,

You'll meet up perfectly with more luck,

En route toward you with some new stuff.



You'll need to jump through some hoops,

And after that, what'll happen is you'll

Realize that the way was preparing you.



It could take much, or a bit, longer -

Either way, you will end up stronger

If you don't dwell on what's wrong.



Work a bit faster on everything.

Go get what you needed to bring

Before the impending upswing.



Preparation helps everyone,

Even if only nearly done

(Because it's utilitarian).



It's not time for you yet.

Patience is your best bet:

Calm is what you'll get.



That won't work this time,

So have an alternative kind

Of tactic, approach, or style.



Despite the fact that you can, you shouldn't.

Not only would it be premature/imprudent,

The timing would have you misconstrue it.



Where you came from and where you are,

Are more different than near is from far.

The past stays finished. Today you start.



No matter where this lands, rebound.

Whether you rate it an up or a down,

Your next will use this as its ground.



Ending one thing always starts another.

Every ending leaves more to discover.

You're the next beginning's best usher.



If all of this has made you tired,

It's good to stop and rest awhile:

Return as your comeback's child.



You know what you're doing,

But need fuel to keep moving

(Recharge before resuming).



Let others call trying hopeless.

Distractions abound, but refocus.

You can improve things you notice.



Although the future invites you to borrow,

The most important thing isn't tomorrow -

It's filling where your world feels hollow.



Reinvent yourself in gradual ways.

Find one new possible path to take,

Or one daily improvement to make.



Reinvention on the personal plane is

Vital because whatever stays the same,

Closes its windows and doors to gain.



Work hard, but leverage your energy

With others - this is called synergy.

Those who work, create their destiny.



Don't expect more than you give.

The gift is you're blessed to live

Knowing you're who light is with.



Grit and a willingness to reinvent

Guarantee you a radiant residence

Great distances from the hesitant.



If your interests run broad and deep

Across as myriad topics as you seek,

Your toolbox can be called complete.



Don't expect anyone to run your torch.

It has been with you along this course

Because you took your flame by force.



Positioning. Who are you working near?

Who can add value to your efforts here?

Who can you mesh with like two gears?



It's not wasting time, but you can improve

By holding others more accountable, too -

Helping each one find their own groove.



If you have a vision, create it yourself.

Because if you wait for everyone else,

It won't be done perfectly - just well.



Limits were not intended for you.

Imagine your way straight through.

Time will make these dreams true.



The barriers might be your sign

That this isn't where you align.

Think about how it feels to try.



How does the latest delay feel?

Does it make your patience peel?

Does your grit dig in its heels?



Like a delicious you haven't tasted yet,

There is so much more for you to get,

Undefinable in your current mindset.



Until you're more flexible, it just waits,

Just past the reach sheer will could take,

To ensure vulnerability's rightful place.



But are they interested? Immaterial.

Not about anyone else, not adversarial,

Take this cue to visit your ethereal.



Be grateful for this perceived lack,

Because what it successfully attacks

Is the lie about even needing that.



When you get to the place of detachment,

You'll notice how much comes back then.

Evade this second attempt at entrapment.



When you decide no more, you are done,

Unable to be turned around by anyone.

An inner shift need only happen once.



Let your letting go happen in solitude

So you don't have to think or bother to

Explain why this arose so impromptu.



If it's dependent on another,

You might run into trouble:

Make sure you can recover.



You don't need it (never did).

Whenever you forgot, you slid.

Of those needy ideas, get rid.



It's this easy: You need it, go get it.

Deny, and the more you'll regret it.

Afterwards, give yourself some credit.



Come out from all that cold

And warm your self-control.

Kudos for maintaining hold.



Waste spite on no one.

Enjoy getting it done:

Take revenge via fun.



Let no one in on your little secret -

That you also embrace your weakness,

And hereby will protect and keep it.



Realize that there's more to you

Than any of these things you do.

Your soul leaves different proof.



The spiritual side of your endeavors

Aims neither to be cool nor clever,

But to enjoy every kind of weather.



Be here for the day and all its weather.

Each tells your mind you can be better,  

And your spirit you've been here forever.



Let the events all play out as they will.

You only need to do what you can until

Things call upon more than your skill.



If they are asking for more than your skill,

Let your predetermined limits set the until

And leave the moment you've had your fill.



Keep striving to do the best you can imagine,

Finding ever-better ways to make that happen.

Getting better at getting better grows passion.



Why do you still want to do that?

Are you sure it's not going back?

Does your heart know for a fact?



You're invaluable when you're honest,

Holding to your own personal promise

To be proud of your own inner conduct.



Stay humble, but proud of your conduct.

When you can be with yourself and just

Know what you won't do - this is trust.



Turn to yourself and make a promise,

A secret inner pact concerning conduct

That only you along with you discuss.



Hurry up and get out there.

If you must, quickly prepare.

This chance is, in short, rare.



How you do it is the whole

Representation of your soul

That will fit within a goal.



Timing isn't everything, but it is most

Of what causes goodness to approach -

Faster the more deeply you're engrossed.



Timing isn't everything, but it is a lot.

In life, simply being in the right spot

Matters more than all the overthought.



Is something wrong? Is it your approach?

Is there a pattern you notice the most?

Is the root of the problem your own?



Are you finished with becoming?

Are you defending doing nothing?

Are you a self-saboteur? Cunning.



Do it for the sake of becoming.

Drop the self-defeating cunning.

Begin this next new something.



Indeed, it will look more polished later.

In this moment, what's actually greater

Is that you've risen to the role, creator.



If you don't do what you should,

You won't reap what you would,

So do what you know you could.



There are so many ways to go about it;

None of which are ones they've touted.

If it guarantees results, do without it.



Your own emotional weather

Won't clear by being clever:

Gather yourselves together.



They are wasting your time again.

No need to think lowly of them,

But the waste - it needs to end.



There will be no shortcuts this time.

Insist on rigorousness from your mind

And savvy of a wholly different kind.



Yes, they're wasting your time again.

No, it doesn't make you less of friends.

Maybe you need to be clear with them.



Don't let them waste your time again.

It limits how high you could extend.

You're accountable to make this end.



Dismiss the idea of shortcuts

Or find yourself stuck there.

Take the way of the tortoise.



The assumptions is where you'll get stuck.

In a tangle of dealings don't get caught up.

Clear-minded honesty meets the best luck.



Do as much of it as you can by yourself.

Once you collaborate with someone else,

You'll seek more refined levels of help.



This time, try a different approach,

One that sharpens focus on the most

Effective kinds of strengths you own.



Are you thinking about it correctly?

Are you basing on what's elementary?

Are you sabotaging things indirectly?



It's who you are that indirectly

Benefits almost like a blessing,

Or a gift that's complimentary.



A closer examination of your thinking

And to what its patterns keep clinging

Gets your obstacles to start shrinking.



How you think is your only control

Over whether you reach your goals

(It's what your inner world holds).



When you let them go on incorrectly,

You're sabotaging yourself indirectly.

You must reorient them ever so gently.



Figure out how much you can handle.

Then take on, chip away, dismantle

Every obstacle to reach your ample.



Decide what you want to accomplish,

Target the distractions to demolish,

And finally set out to self-astonish.



You will be astonished at

How much you accomplish

With the right accomplice.



You're getting close

To what you almost

Can call engrossed.



Know what you need to measure

To gauge how close to treasure

You are in your day's adventure.



If the conversation begins to loop,

What's chronic, no longer acute -

Is the need for goodness to swoop.



Heard enough backstories to last?

Had your fill recounting the past?

Have a present that is unabashed.



To be so close and still stuck

Indicates the presence of a rut,

Or a cord that needs to be cut.



If yet and still too little has changed,

Let the distance between you remain

Until one of you reaches new terrain.



How much can you know? Precious little

Of which parts are durable versus brittle.

Therefore keep today's approach simple.



But if your approach is always kept simple,

How much will you learn? Precious little,

So venture out where certainty is brittle.



You have no business fixating on that,

Unless you like falling into time traps.

Today does not know how to go back.



Is this the right thing to be focused on?

What happens if that decision is wrong?

On which choice does your heart belong?



Assuming any of that matters, then what?

How much of your time will you entrust?

When would you be convinced to give up?



How would you know if this was far enough?

When would you decide it's time to give up?

Where would you shift your time and love?



How does their choice impact you?

How dare you surrender your mood.

How can that control your attitude?



Falling behind? In what, exactly?

To someone else, it's satisfactory.

Be objective (matter-of-factly).



You have every reason to believe

You have the ability to achieve

Anything you dare to conceive.



The biggest obstacle isn't you:

It's the beliefs you hold on to.

Let go, and it will let go, too.



Your greatest partnership is you

Joining with the belief in who

You are beyond what you pursue.



Don't resist the difficulty - bear it.

It is not here for you to repair it.

You and the events are disparate.



The choice is not between this or that:

The choice is between present or past,

Between forging ahead or leaning back.



By moving at the proper speed,

You'll find you're easily freed

Of those clinging onto needs.



The real reason that you need

To reach a more fitting speed

Is to get yourself fully freed.



The importance of increasing speed

Is to evade, escape, elude, be freed

From those with smothering needs.



Safety isn't what you now need;

On the contrary, it's to be freed

To attain unprecedented speed.



Within, you are completely free

To move at unbelievable speed,

Breaking through all you need.



It is not about attaining speed,

But about getting yourself freed

From all their unnecessary needs.



What is it you actually need?

To attain breathtaking speed,

Or to feel breathtakingly free?



Finishing by way of speed,

Rather than meeting needs,

Is the wrong way indeed.



There's no point in staying on guard

When you're the one who's in charge.

In short, you needn't work this hard.



You might feel you've been charged

With being the one to be on guard,

But that makes things unduly hard.



Yes, you are in charge:

No, not to be a guard -

To bravely journey far.



Since you are in charge,

Keep in mind to guard

Against offers bizarre.



Do you realize how rare

You are, willing to dare

Time and again to care?



Willingness to share

Is the secret to care.

You're already aware.



It is a living gift to be so inclined

To serve with both heart and mind,

As only a loving soul could design.



Throughout your life, all you design

Are mere artifacts meant to remind

You that infinitely more wait inside.



Of all the ideas that you devise,

No matter how grand in design,

The designer is the truest find.



As you're attempting to design

What's whispered in your mind,

Try to be protectively inclined.



The idea that you can dive too deep,

Or climb a mountain that's too steep

Is one that you can safely put to sleep.



This particular situation

Begs your imagination:

Today is its invitation.



Think of every situation

As a formal invitation to

Arrive in full imagination.



Sometimes a personality concoction

Earns the rank of utterly obnoxious,

But dares you to be more conscious.



Catch yourself - what you're claiming.

Because if you are indeed blaming,

Your own standards need raising.



It is easier to point out the obnoxious

Than to do what's even more obvious,

Which is to become more conscious.



In the moment, it can seem so obvious:

It's all their fault - they're obnoxious.

But it's an invitation to be conscious.



Reminders to be more conscious

Can only ever be but so obvious.

Need them to be plain obnoxious?



When your standards keep raising,

There's a lower chance of blaming

Anyone for how you're behaving.



How you are behaving

May help in explaining

Your results' swaying.



Continually collapsing layers is useful.

To think that's the point is untruthful.

Do it in order to become more fruitful.



In order to be more fruitful,

First become more truthful

About what feels most useful.



You will find that being truthful

Is one fantastic way to be useful,

Helping others be more fruitful.



Today you will be most useful

When working to be truthful,

Rather than simply fruitful.



When you're done striving to be fruitful,

Stop for a moment, and just be truthful:

When do you feel most easefully useful?



The path of being fruitful

Can only be but so useful

Without joy that's crucial.



What annoys you points within

To something you should begin

To contemplate - fist to chin.



You have to believe you will arrive

At a place where ease already abides

Where also awaits your ideal stride.



Of the things you don't like to do,

Which stir the worst feelings too?

From these, it is time you moved.



The message from things that bother

Is not to do them more or less often,

But to get what's hardened to soften.



Unless you have something to express,

Use the moment to practice stillness.

Use more of your time to do far less.



When you are able to give your time,

Everything else is trivial, subprime.

Longer you linger, the more divine.



It's worthy of some mention:

Beware yet more reinvention.

Broadening won't strengthen.



Whether to deepen or to lengthen?

Sometimes broadening strengthens.

Where it does, so may reinvention.



There is power in repetition:

Under the cycle's supervision,

Life lives outside indecision.



If you already know what they'll do,

You're accountable when things loop.

So, ahead of time is when to regroup.



There is more power in repetition.

There, freed from more decisions,

There is an unquestioned mission.



There are things worthy of repetition -

Those that afterwards leave you wishing

They could be an everlasting tradition.



When in the land of reinvention,

Be aware. Pay careful attention:

Some parts deserve exemption.



Constant reinvention

Calls for apprehension,

Or at least, attention.



There is power in repetition.

It strengthens your position,

And creates/deepens tradition.



How much do you need to focus on that?

Are you trying to invite some of it back?

Whatever you discuss, you surely attract.



Have you picked another unsolvable one,

A problem that refuses to ever be done?

Why not do something you find fun?



Grappling more unsolvable problems

Is something that can happen often,

Until you start to spiritually soften.



Doing the wrong thing right,

Dangles satisfaction's delight,

But does it give you insight?



Doing right things the wrong way

Builds up a backlog of disarray, so

Start over when things go astray.



Doing the wrong thing correctly,

Is still good practice, indirectly:

Do the right thing impeccably.




Doing the right thing at the wrong time

Will return a result that can feel unkind,

But is the best feedback you'll ever find.



Affected, but were you transformed?

Wherever you go, you'll get absorbed,

So go places where you're not ignored.



What you indulge, you might regret.

What you remember, you may forget.

What you've felt, hasn't left you yet.



Doing the wrong thing at the right time

Is the illusion of momentum, by design.

You must ascertain what actually aligns.



Doing the right thing at the wrong time

Is the illusion of correctness, by design,

But misses the point - which is to align.



Like opening an unexpected gift,

Achieving gives your spirit a lift,

So accept the invitation: Commit.



What you can measure, you can manage.

You can use this fact to your advantage,

To do great things (without damage).



Overextending yourself gets nothing done.

Dabbling in everything makes for less fun.

You are all things, and yet strongest as one.



Do things your way - hold your standards.

Identify anything that mopes or meanders

As something you'll immediately handle.



There's much more you'll be able to handle

As you uphold and then raise your standards.

You are hereby promoted to self-commander.



No one else will do

What you know to:

Don't act subdued.



You may not mind

That it's unkind -

But it's not fine.



Would they do the same for you?

What would they have let ensue?

Will you do a thorough review?



They'll respect you more for your truth

Than for bending your standards to suit

(There is power in remaining resolute).



Becoming flexible has its strengths.

There's also power in knowing when

To be staunchly steadfast till the end.



Everyone faces their own version of it.

That's all the more reason not to quit:

You can show how to be spiritually fit.



Have you found yourself an unsolvable one?

If so, why not declare yourself hereby done?

You are here to combine finishing with fun.



If in the end, it seems to be unsolvable,

It might not be completely impossible,

But continuing might be irresponsible.



You will know, and that will be enough.

The way can be rigorous and even rough,

But there are limits to being rebuffed.



Trust that you will know precisely when

Those times of tirelessly trying to end.

In a timeless manner, you will not bend.



Nothing that can be done will undo you,

For you continue with nothing to prove,

And nothing held back - you're resolute.



You may not be able to perfectly explain;

That's not a good reason not to maintain

The wildly creative storm in your brain.



Doing things that self-destruct

Accidentally render you unstuck

If you notice what they interrupt.



You could stop anytime now. 

Do you still remember how?

Is it something you'll allow?



Like breathing with fewer breaths,

Always seek to gain more with less,

With deeper - yet fewer - requests.



Is this the you you actually want to be -

A reaction to circumstance's triggering?

If not, remove your triggers decidedly.



It will all work out in the end.

Take it as a sign if it hasn't yet;

Goodness is just around the bend.



The healthiest possible you

Is the best reply to those who

Had helped unravel and undo.



The best revenge will be living well,

Because along the way, you'll compel

Others to likewise, despite all, excel.



Who are you to you, though?

Could you thoroughly know?

Can you, through this, flow?



Forgive yourself, trusting you don't know

The full extent of what caused you to blow.

Trust that there's a stirring in your soul.



You don't understand everything about you,

So stop behaving/masquerading as if you do.

You are here to actively explore, not prove.



And just like that, you will have arrived,

Realizing there's no concept of "in-time,"

Discovering you've always been just fine.



Do you know you're emotionally accountable

To yourself, even if it feels insurmountable?

Even if the verdict seems unpronounceable?



Emotional accountability is no less

Than that of finances or the breath:

You're responsible to at least check.



The reason you do a thing matters

More than what actually happens:

Good intentions beat bad reactions.



The reason you do anything matters,

Not to get your hopes to happen, but

To refine your sense of satisfaction.



You don't know what you will,

So focus on sharpening skills

That help you travel uphill.



The number will be bigger than it's been,

Because things aren't what they've seemed;

Time to get yourself out from in between.



Even though you can't measure it,

Even the way they've presented it,

Everything is here for your benefit.



Everything's here to benefit you.

Even what can get misconstrued

As an uneven event, even a feud.



You can lean right or dodge wrong.

You can hike short or journey long.

You can learn from it if you want.



You can learn from this if you choose.

You can learn more from what you lose.

You can learn from every healing bruise.



How do you heal from the injury? Time.

What's the most healing way to be? Kind.

How does it feel to be this way? Sublime.



For you to rise to reach a new range,

Things are going to have to change,

Even things you'd rather not name.



How you frame everything matters -

Not because of the way it happens -

Because framing makes you master.



Who is this particular version

Of your whole entire person?

What part is most uncertain?



This specific version

Of you as a full person

Is a gift, for certain.



Today's version will be uncertain

Until you yourself arrive in person

To decide what must be determined.



Giving and receiving slide into disarray

Not when things move more in one way,

But when one is exaggeratedly conveyed.



Good, bad, or indifferent, you can't flee.

You need to provide your own guarantee

That you'll improve to a greater degree.



Do you have a clear perception of it?

Do you have an idea of where you fit?

Do you have a sense of your inner mix?



Understanding their attitude -

Namely, the part aimed at you,

Could serve some future use.



Where you began, you aren't anymore.

You don't do any of what you did before

(Be fair if you're going to keep score).



Don't seek to be normal.

That would be abhorrent

When you can be a torrent.



There is a time for sifting,

But it needs to be uplifting

In order to avoid drifting.



Regarding revisiting old wounds,

Keep in mind you'll get back soon

To what more directly improves.



Digging is how you will get to the bottom

Of things that may need you to solve them.

Planting is how you get things to blossom.



Have you found memory sifting

Another way to end up drifting?

What might be more uplifting?



Describing problems versus solving them

Is the issue from which all of this stems:

There is no benefit to rehashing it again.



Think about it in a very different way -

One you've never had anyone else convey;

Add that to your nimble mind's dossier.



What if you already figured it out

Then handed it over to self-doubt?

You are the obstacle to surmount.



When you obstruct your own way,

What role do you aim to portray?

What are you trying to convey?



Who are the best ones around you? Reflect.

What good things happen when you connect?

Realize you're the cause, they're the effect.



What you know to do, don't forget.

On all you keep learning, reflect -

Even if the answer isn't clear yet.



Doing fewer things that harm

Is still some cause for alarm,

Like a bomb mostly disarmed.



Believe in yourself firmly.

Answer opposition sternly

(Let critics feel squirmy).



Just a bit more and you can take a break.

Just a bit farther before you can partake.

Just a bit further for your effort's sake.



You know what's possible - you sense it.

You know that the process is intensive.

You know if you don't, you'll regret it.



You know all you're doing.

What you've been accruing

Is how you keep producing.



You're welcome to travel hither and yon

To relearn what you've known all along:

Your deepest sense has never been wrong.



Each of the special people in your day reflects

That you are your life's cause - not its effect:

Without you, with whom would they connect?



You are the cause, not the effect.

If this isn't clear to you just yet,

You have some history to unforget.



What if the best is yet to come?

What if you've only just begun?

What if what awaits you is fun?



What if you're only on the cusp

Of incredible things coming up

Nearly close enough to touch?



Set yourself free

From normalcy

(Brevity is key).



If you get too attached to the words,

Seriousness slowly becomes absurd.

Away from the tangle of terms, turn.



It's not the words, but attachment to them

That clings to enemies instead of a friend.

Let go of semantics. Embrace sentiment.



Are you wrapped in a web of words?

Does your predicament feel absurd?

Can you change what they inferred?



Do their captions match what occurred?

Do you feel tangled up into their terms?

Do you remember the feeling you prefer?



That's enough of feeling guilty, of

Turning your flow's channel silty.

Remind yourself, "I'm still me."



That wasn't what you meant,

So return what they've sent.

Only you know your intent.



Be certain of what you know -

That what they claim, isn't so.

Now, find another way to flow.



In time, you'll understand it differently.

Right now you understand it sufficiently,

But time will reveal the rest brilliantly.



Apologies aren't as lasting as resolve.

Over time, sorries eventually dissolve,

But who you become changes it all.



You'll cycle until you become better.

Let the trigger be this, that, whatever

For you to break that pattern forever.



Perhaps you do need to apologize.

To whom? That's yours to realize

(To you - they're you in disguise).



Maybe an apology is in order.

Denial's path seems shorter,

But traps you into a corner.



Maybe you do indeed need to apologize.

But that's something you may recognize

After their response starts to materialize.



Not all who demand an apology deserve

Simply because they've piled up words.

Check in with your heart and soul first.



What can be said except, apologize.

Above the back and forth of this, rise

So your energy can go where it applies.



This is an opportunity in disguise.

Don't wait for a response to arise.

Skip the whole thing: Apologize.



Hold that apology,

Not as policy, but

Till there's quality.



Maybe this one is that opportunity

That addresses this pressing need

You have to do more than just be.



Be straightforward if you at all can.

Even though it's in greater demand,

Complexity is harder to understand.



But how many degrees are you from center?

Far enough to warrant becoming an inventor

Of the world's first daily-drifting preventer?



At sea, a damaged ship founders

Unless fortunate to encounter

Help beyond alarm-sounders.



If you knew you were now halfway,

Would that urge you into a hooray?

Then keep on moving, don't stay.



Every day is a chance to move it forward,

Or simply stay inside yesterday's borders.

But you'll never be spiritually cornered.



Nothing can corner you into impossibility,

Because every moment bestows a mobility

To shift your consciousness immediately.



Even/especially when you feel neglected,

You can always change your perspective

Into one that's infinitely more effective.



What's always available to renovate

Is the inner space only you create,

The one before you can collaborate.



Before you go and collaborate,

You might move to invigorate

Your own inner creative space.



Without being cruel, be thorough:

How deep did all that time burrow

Beneath where you needed to flow?



Doing many things you enjoy

Is a beautifully wrapped ploy:

Make a daily, focused choice.



Do things in the best order

So that delays get cornered

As you go straight forward.



Keep choosing and you'll land

On better than you understand:

Goodness supplies upon demand.



Just as a steep mountain slopes,

Things will bend to your hopes,

From good fortune to fine folks.



Some recognize exactly what you've done,

And when you meet them, they're pure fun,

Finishing sentences you've not yet begun.



Hold your need to be validated

Until your situation's elevated

Above where it felt relegated.



It's a tricky thing - this validation.

Seeking it too early is an invitation

To the most superficial admiration.



Take your time when seeking validation.

The further you go, the more moderation,

The more transformative the confirmation.



Deep validation

Spares admiration

For observation.



It's fine and good to have a way,

But not if it cannot be changed

Once its reason for being fades.



Hopefully this heals without hurt:

Until they've done deep inner work,

They'll resort to assumptions first.



If you resort to your assumptions first,

You'll likely awaken everyone's worst.

They had nothing to do with that hurt.



They can't be held responsible

For what was just unstoppable,

So don't add to their troubles.



Everyone has their own rucksack of woes,

The contents of which no one fully knows,

So extend empathy for what everyone stows.



Sometimes people can annoy,

But it's still possible to enjoy

Moments they cannot destroy.



Sometimes time brings distance,

Which can make you miss them;

Use it to cherish their existence.



Playfulness is a spice of life,

But playfulness can spark strife,

Which may still entertain despite.



If they tend to whine,

Take it as a clear sign

To give them less time.



One reason to complain less

Is so there's an even guess

Whether you might say yes.



Do they acknowledge only after you shout?

Do you understand what any of that's about?

Is it time to let your honest feelings out?



There aren't as many limitations

As there are genuine occasions

To set down your expectations.



You can always find a reason to laugh,

Even if it's one you personally craft

And share on everyone else's behalf.



Calm down. This is where you're at home.

Tranquility's door opens as you approach.

Behind you, serenity will gently close it.



Your past is behind you, future ahead.

You could focus on either, or instead,

Get these presents between to spread.



Love's worse than powerless in the abstract.

Loving words gently defend, mildly attack.

Love becomes powerful the moment you act.



What use has the sun with one hour?

Or a raindrop with a thundershower?

Likewise, love has no use for power.



Love is powerless if you hide behind words,

And unloving power borders on the absurd.

Living lovingly creates a power undeterred.



Love has more meaning that we give it.

Love potential knows no natural limit.

Yet love can do little until you live it.



Love is what gives your actions power,

Within, which then spreads to the outer

World, which then uses love to flower.



Be they parent, peer, helper, or healer,

Love is about as powerful as its wielder

(Most effective as intention's revealer).



Go deeper than you have before.

Seek out clarity. Ask for more.

Find out all that's truly yours.



Give more to them than chitchat

And you're guaranteed to get back

The reasons why they ever did that.



Expect more from conversations than that.

You cannot thrive on predictable chitchat.

Your wits deserve a more vibrant habitat.



Offer more than you have to date,

Trusting that whatever may await

Will find you in an amazing state.



If they linger past their welcome,

Your presence helps, and then some

Because your way clears the tension.



Delve deeper into your day's mundane,

Beholding all that it magically untames

In the same place once deceptively plain.



There are so many reasons not to get riled,

Not the least of which is, it's been awhile.

The main reason? It's no longer your style.



Save your emotions for something else.

Leave that at the bottom of your well

As you find more ways to feel swell.



Of course it may seem insignificant,

But it's time to grow diligence about

When and why you feel indifference.



Eventually it will stop -

Every bit of drama drops

Upon refusing response.



What they ask you to repeat

May your patience unseat

(So breathe and release).



This time around, you come first.

This time, offer up fewer words.

This time, do what you prefer.



This time around, put yourself first.

Regardless of whatever else occurs,

Your inner voice must be heard.



This time, you have to matter more.

You've tried every other way before.

This time, be still and then be sure.



Of the things you cannot change,

How many belong in your brain?

Only what you affect can stay.



You amass momentum by attaining goals.

You amass awareness by letting them go.

You amass love by helping others grow.



As you ask better and better questions

You branch out into other dimensions,

Experiencing both depth and ascension.



Your experience is what you're having,

So from their story start detaching as

Your awareness's egg is now hatching.



Who will you choose to be today?

One who rebels or one who obeys?

Observe while you pick either way.



Is it something you can sustain?

What it provides, will you retain

(How might it help you abstain)?



Is this a pace you can or should sustain?

What might you encounter along this way?

How much of the road ahead can you ascertain?



It is more about where you can sustain,

Than how much you can juggle or retain.

Go where they're helping each other attain.



Are these the activities to sustain?

Are those the best friends to retain?

In either, is the best of you contained?



What do you need to do to sustain

A pace that will help you retain

Your strengths as you also change?



What else do you need in order to sustain

A pace in which what's good gets retained

And you end up engrossed and engaged?



If this is a pace you can sustain,

You'll do more than just retain -

Whatever you lost, you'll regain.



Be grateful you're so very unique.

This way, you need no technique

(You have preexisting mystique).



Is this a daily pace you can sustain

While simultaneously trying to retain

Those of your former goals that remain?



This is what you must ask yourself first:

Exactly how much is an outcome worth?

Answer before getting yourself immersed.



It's about what something is worth

Before you dive in headlong first;

Don't get your energy so dispersed.



You have to try harder than before

In order to unleash so much more

Of what is waiting to be adored.



The moment you make it formulaic,

The rest will grow boring, prosaic:

Keep your process raw and basic.



Your feelings must be forefront

This is perhaps most important

(To the point of enforcement).



There's nothing worse than apathy,

So even if you can't do it happily,

Feel everything in its raw totality.



You are guaranteed to not be bored

Daydreaming about moving toward

Whatever might also be in store.



Thinking unproductive thoughts

Is where progress can get caught,

So pay whatever clear focus costs.



The right thoughts at the wrong time

Will at least grant you peace of mind;

Better thinking is always worth a try.



Thinking about what you can't control

Is a sneaky way to sabotage your goal -

Dive deeper into what you well know.



This is not the time to venture out,

To wander, explore or roam about -

This is the time to stay and sprout.



What exactly should you be focused on?

Which thoughts should now be forgone?

What could sustained attention spawn?



The moment you give focus an attempt,

You succeed in moving yourself ahead

Just by working toward, not against.



Thinking about the wrong things the right way

Is more harmful than a clever turn of phrase,

It is a formula for leading yourself astray.



Doing the right things at the wrong time

Commit an inward, self-inflicting crime

Justice is done the moment you align.



At this stage, it has to be all of you.

Give everything or risk being untrue

To the creativity within - that's who.



To focus on the littles delays a lot.

Don't let the details get you caught.

Invite mastery of minutiae to stop.



Focus on the details to meet your mark.

Mastery makes up for every bumpy start

By infusing your dedication with heart.



You can no waste no more time on facts

So removed from your chosen goal that

You could not re-add what they subtract.



Wish them well with what's theirs,

But you cannot fix others' affairs.

You can manage your own repairs.



You have the keys that open those doors,

But not when you do as you did before.

This time, the locksmith is your core.



Don't do too much of that

Because it'll set you back

(Above all, stay on track).



You don't have to be precise

(Being lenient is also nice);

Just being aware will suffice.



Above all, be true -

With nothing to prove,

Only forward to move.



What you did not knowing better,

Forgive. Ignorance is not an error

(Not outgrowing it is, however).



No need to judge, but simply measure,

Not to add any unnecessary pressure -

To know if you're getting any better.



The caliber of your conversations, measure.

Let no one communicate with you however

It suits them. Your progress deserves better.



You cannot manage what you do not measure.

So start from the edge or from your center,

And gauge by depth, intensity, or whatever.



Pause and take the time to measure

Whatever you wish to make better,

Patiently pruning your own errors.



The distance between you and your dreams

Gets shorter than sometimes it might seem

By working less on tasks, more on beliefs.



The distance between here and there

Is shorter than it seems, so be aware

Whatever you do leads somewhere.



We don't need for each others' brains

To endlessly, meticulously explain -

We need to share our heartfelt aims.



If you must, briefly share your pain

With someone whose trust sustains.

Then quickly, get back to your aim.



It is that intensity of feeling,

On the uneasy verge of reeling

That will remove your ceiling.



What you need is exactly this feeling

For precisely what it's now revealing,

That something is finally congealing.



You need this specific feeling,

No matter how unappealing

For all that it is revealing.



Now this is a feeling

You need for dealing,

Or else, for leaving.



This is one of those feelings

That takes layers of peeling

To find what it's concealing.



That is one of those tricky feelings

That is actually cleverly concealing

The fact that you are still reeling.



If you are still reeling,

Face this uneasy feeling

And find deeper healing.



You could not have known

How everything would go.

This is just how you grow.



Your strengths and weaknesses abound.

A list would both embarrass and astound;

Be as humble as you deserve to be proud.



Journeys that take a set amount of time

Are beneath where you are on this climb.

Dare to take forever to feel truly aligned.



There's a lot to leave behind.

As to where most of it resides?

No further than your own mind.



Most of those thoughts were borrowed.

So getting new ones for your tomorrow

May mean briefly feeling a bit hollowed.



Most of what they'd like you to think

Is too far outside the acceptable brink

Of where your inner bridge should link.



Always check how that is working for them

Before you get yourself into any agreement.

Patterns tie the future down with precedent.



If they haven't cut their ties to it,

You're likewise swirling in the mix

(Escaping has a timely seriousness).



What they disregard, you may inherit.

So if what's in question has no merit,

You next move makes itself apparent.



If this were the end, how would you be?

Could you let go of all this contentedly?

What inner goal would you rather achieve?



Adhere to your own definition

Of what it means to be finished,

Granting your own next wishes.



After today, then what happens?

Free your mind to fully imagine,

Minus everyone else's reaction.



What if that was the wrong issue

To focus on, master, or submit to?

There's still time to commit anew.



What if the time has past for wandering?

What if that's not what to be pondering?

What if it's time to not be bothering?



What if you're further along,

Where nothing is wrong, and

Where you actually belong?



The things you cannot control

Must - at very least - be known

So you can let each of them go.



That over which you have no control,

You have no choice other than to let go

Lest you risk everything else you hold.



If they won't help with the solution,

They're as welcome as an intrusion

(But at least there's no confusion).



If they can't help with your solution,

That doesn't make them totally useless:

Doing the opposite braves the unproven.



For the time being, you may have to endure

Obstacles of which you might feel very sure

Are the problem. No, discomfort's the cure.



That will be that, before you realize,

So don't lollygag with compromise,

Nor loiter with those who theorize.



You need results - not more preparation.

Ignore any further in-depth evaluation.

You're a train now leaving their station.



Like a train needing to leave the station,

You must alert immediate disembarkation

For those interested only in preparation.



What's coming next

You can't know yet;

Take a deep breath.



They don't have your answer. You asked.

The best they can do is list empty tasks.

This is your time to independently act.



Act, even when it feels forced.

You'll attract stronger support

By doing what builds rapport.



A few good actions are all you need

To get your best intentions set free

To manifest the greatness of belief.



You will bring it into reality,

Which creates more causality

That in turn cures neutrality.



As a matter of fact, you certainly will.

Not because you have the right skills,

But because you have a depth to fill.



And this is where things come to a head,

Where the weave binds with one thread,

Where you choose another way instead.



The path will diverge into two.

You will know which to choose

(Not based on what, but who).



Without the proper treatment,

A strength becomes a weakness:

Make the doing more frequent.



Your strength is also your weakness

If you don't have a little meekness.

Strength requires proper treatment.



Strength becomes weakness depending

On which activities you're attending.

Strength pays the time you're spending.



Your strengths require more investing -

More time doing, better time resting -

Opposite of all weakness is suggesting.



Strength becomes weakness depending

On who you're currently befriending

(Weakness will keep on pretending).



Strength becomes weakness depending

On where you take it for presenting.

Go where you grow from blending.



Strength can turn into weakness

If intensity becomes infrequent

(Train with a quiet meanness).



If you spend time with a cheapness,

You turn strength into a weakness.

Generously fund your uniqueness.



Nothing can be done until you decide

Whether you'll stay here on the side,

Or venture out there to give it a try.



Nothing changes until you do first.

What can happen, at least, at worst,

Is comfort's dust will be dispersed.



Try once more, for good measure.

You may not unearth the treasure,

But you'll bring things together.



There is a strength to even a weakness.

That balances your specific uniqueness

And demonstrates your completeness.



There is strength in that weakness.

It helps you climb the steepness by

Laughing at the ascent's bleakness.



There is strength in having a weakness.

It prevents feeling uneasy concreteness

And shows off a lovely incompleteness.



That is a strength, not a weakness.

Where others experience bleakness,

You defy via unbridled uniqueness.



This is your strength, not a weakness,

The ability to meet doubt's cheapness

With your confidence's concreteness.



Call it anything but a weakness.

It helps you climb the steepness

And defies their fake meekness.



Consider it anything but weakness,

Your ability to brave the bleakness

Freed from the bonds of neatness.



It's only a weakness

If it's fake meekness.

Use your keenness.



It's not a weakness.

It's pure uniqueness,

And it intrigues us.



If ten times more doesn't feel a tenth,

And ten times deeper's shallow depth,

What you've discovered is strength.



Between your weaknesses and strengths,

The ones that win out by any day's end

Are the ones you do with close friends.



Operate from your greatest strengths -

Things you love doing again and again

In secret hopes the doing never ends.



Give from your greatest strengths,

The ones that plumb your depths,

And still haven't reached an end.



Most especially when

Everyone gets tense,

Use your strengths.



This is your strength -

So don't even pretend.

Share your excellence.



The journey of your strengths

Attracts many traveling friends:

Pick ones who can go the length.



You are going to get through

Without doing anything new

(Except a once daily review).



Weakness yields to strength

Among supportive friends,

So seek them out again.



Check in with your body to know

Where stress has tried to burrow,

And how deeply you must let go.



Your body was simply trying to help

By stashing stress so swiftly and well;

Let warm water flush it from every cell.



Your body was initially trying to help,

Burying each stress fire deep and well;

Let cold water purge it from every cell.



They may not even notice you withdrew,

As they're unable to let it be about you:

Interdependence is therefore through.



If that moment required a reaction,

Afterwards, where tension fastened,

Do a gentle and thorough extraction.



You will often be invited to react,

Even if to simply turn your back.

Remember, you're never trapped.



When in the jungle of the petty,

Brandish your mental machete,

Cutting clear, swift, and steady.



What they do doesn't warrant reaction.

Nor does it deserve attention's passion

Or whatever else gives it satisfaction.



If you cannot stop it,

Your mind can drop it.

Shut concern's faucet.



What you're able to do, by all means do.

But the moment you overextend to pursue,

Is the moment imbalance will find you.



Perspective shrouds you in grace,

Prevents pain from being a waste,

Prepares for you that better place.



Whichever default state

You choose to cultivate

Will each day remake.



Insist on it getting better, and it will.

Nothing can reach beliefs you instill

In yourself as you continue to build.



Switching to that before finishing this

Can sometimes create a whole new mix

(Ask yourself if this is where that fits).



Who you connect with

Prepares your next fit:

Mind where you mix.



Congratulations, you're almost done.

Hopefully you had yourself some fun,

However, the best is truly yet to come.



You'll get to it all, all in due time.

It may not fall in one straight line,

But every desired result will arrive.



Something in you knows

Worry has little to show

When belief is all aglow.



Steady, you are almost there.

Carefully, just remain aware.

Consciously, yet without a care.



&ldquo;Breakthroughs&rdquo; that lead nowhere

Are delusions of which to beware.

True breakthroughs basically dare.



&ldquo;Breakthroughs&rdquo; that point somewhere

Lead to delusions of which to beware

(True breakthroughs wouldn't care).



A breakthrough may feel like a dare

To focus toward a new somewhere.

Know this invitation can be rare.



Only one thing seems likely to help this.

No one's going to tell you what that is -

So tap into where you feel the best fit.



Do more thinking than you did last time,

But instead of thinking from your mind,

Think based on that feeling deep inside.



Where do you already feel the best fit?

You can't explain, but you just intuit.

When you sense this, you must do it.



Don't rush to suggest.

Let time give its test.

Wait awhile to check.



Wait out your initial excitement,

Not to offer a sharper indictment,

But to enjoy even better alignment.



That initial excitement was thrilling,

But now you have to be daily willing

To do all that it takes for fulfilling.



If you do your part, but they don't,

Will what you want have any hope?

Make your chances far less remote.



You did your part, but they gave an excuse.

Are a pile of reasons anything you can use?

Be kind, but overhaul the way you choose.



You did your part, but theirs isn't done.

The excuse is that it was no longer fun;

Mistakes are best when only made once.



How do you feel? Elated?

Over how you've created,

Or meeting the awaited?



How do you feel? Incredible?

Like you made it inevitable?

Like you deserve a festival?



How do you feel? Like celebrating?

Rewarded for bravely accelerating?

Being worthy of commemorating?



Does it feel like it was all inevitable?

Even when the losses were regrettable?

Your commitment has been incredible.



There's no reason to accept -

None, that is, perhaps except

The end isn't ready quite yet.



Go, but in a way that's best prepared

To keep your energy always where

You can pivot from here to there.



By all means, be better prepared.

However, also remain fully aware

The moment will offer you a dare.



Be as prepared as you possibly can,

But embrace where you finally land

Whether or not you fully understand.



Preparation means simplifying

To leave room for improvising

(&#224; la last-minute overriding).



Prepare in a way that leaves room

For preparation itself to improve

Based on how thoroughly you do.



Once you arrive, how will you know

Which new way is then best to go?

By remembering you can say so.



You're going, but as you are already.

Becoming someone else unsteadies.

Presentation should not be heady.



You will eventually return -

And with different concerns.

What will your heart yearn?



When will you have had enough?

It doesn't have to be this tough.

Why not bring your standards up?



Go, but be who you are nonetheless:

Being is the higher form of success

(So stop worrying what comes next).



There's not as much to that

As you thought farther back,

Nothing to defend or attack.



The heap will continue to rise.

Given that it's already too high,

Do what topples the whole pile.



Consider the ultimate result.

Will it get you so engulfed

You lose sense of enough?



Each part needs to be fed

To move the whole ahead;

Don't too thinly spread.



Does it feel like this is enough?

Is this anything like the result

Your wildest dreams foretold of?



There are so many options to peruse.

It doesn't matter which you choose -

Each one provides something of use.



Don't spend more time reviewing

What you were originally doing

Than in actual forward moving.



Whether you work despite or against,

Will yourself to every possible length

To face a weakness with full strength.



When you need a little boost of faith,

Recall, despite that, what you became:

Isn't it limitless what you can create?



It's not necessary to think those thoughts

Especially involving things you have not

Even the faintest ability to slow or stop.



If you're finding yourself there again,

By reaching rock bottom or wit's end,

Enough weakness can forge a strength.



Rather than continuing to compare,

It will be better to focus elsewhere

So you can properly plan or prepare.



When you have no control there,

Don't dabble in doubt's despair:

Become that much more aware.



Sometimes, it is necessary to escape, to

Refuse to continue to be made to wait,

To get your own way out to take shape.



Sometimes, the best thing is to escape -

To acknowledge being here as a mistake,

And decide to never again be contained.



Sometimes, the right thing is to escape,

To come to terms with what's at stake,

And leave behind whoever's too afraid.



Sometimes, the fitting choice is to escape,

To refuse to accept any more false claims,

And determine to not pass this way again.



Come to terms with what's at stake

(Circular patterns must be escaped)

Especially when all you do is wait.



And now, it is time to escape.

Get out before it's too late to

Learn from all their mistakes.



Regardless of what wasters claim,

Wastes of time must be escaped.

If only you knew what's at stake.



Do not engage in one more debate.

It is useless, pointless. Yes, escape.

Travel to a more substantial place.



Do you have the will to escape

The predictable traps they lay?

Good, then don't go that way.



Rather than get stuck, and have to escape,

Instead don't even start heading that way.

There's still time to do something great.



Do you feel almost forced to partake?

Don't go along simply for their sakes.

Decide if this is your time to escape.



Are you feeling somewhat contained?

There are no walls, though they claim.

Nothing can stop you. Time to escape.



Beware the strong who prefer the meek

Not alongside, but somewhere beneath.

Balance is what genuine strength keeps.



Beware the weak who hide behind the strong

Supposedly in search of somewhere to belong.

Be vulnerable (However, be no one's pawn).



Wait a bit for the contradictions to arise.

Let inconsistencies come as no surprise,

Use them to fully feel what you decide.



If they're chasing two things at once,

Helping would make who the dunce?

Refuse kindly, however, be upfront.



This might call for a sort of denial

Of reality, at least for a little while,

Until things begin an upward spiral.



It's understandable, to be in denial,

That is, at least, for a little while,

Until you finally break your cycle.



Let sleepy ones remain at rest;

The unwilling don't need a test.

Do something different instead.



Check, do they actually act?

Pile past proof up in stack -

Just so it's a matter of fact.



They're pushing your outer limits,

Turning your smile into a grimace;

Take a few extra resetting minutes.



It's a result of easing your standards.

It wasn't unjust, what you demanded

(It was critical for catching bandits).



Notice closely, do they process yours

The same way you did theirs, before?

The point? Empathy cannot be forced.



The moment you encounter apathy,

Don't just go around it unhappily -

Make a note in your inner mappery.



They may not care the same way you do.

Though a bit sad, it is nonetheless true.

The best response is to gradually move.



Is it as if they're your competitor -

Or some kind of unwanted creditor?

These things take longer to register.



Or course, you naturally assumed

The best, but they gave no proof.

What then, are your next moves?



Some things feel good to believe,

But aren't as helpful as they seem.

Better to float down life's stream.



There are clues more accurate than words

That don't have to all link together first,

That altogether explain what will occur.



Presuming any of them will act like you

Is something for which you lack proof.

Thus, independently think and choose.



Stop taking on more than is sensible.

Start becoming much more amenable

To making your volunteering tenable.



Make your volunteering more sensible.

That level is simply no longer tenable,

So trust others' help will be plentiful.



Give your effort the respect it deserves.

Others will rise to the level they observe

You showing of your own inner terms.



Doing what presents as foe or friend

May or may not be what they intend:

Clarity is something time will lend.



Things that you once ago deemed fine

Are now not even worthy of your time,

Proof you will only continue to rise.



Own your work. Don't be anyone's cog.

Still, don't get caught in control's fog.

Stay devoted to your deepening cause.



That doesn't have to be your choice,

And you don't have to get annoyed.

Your personal preference has a voice.



If they can point out where you're wrong,

But can't direct you to where you belong,

Their weakness is forgetting you're strong.



Just because they show how you're wrong,

Doesn't mean they know where you belong.

Criticism is weak. Intuition grows strong.



All that came before, brought you here.

All that will come, awaits with cheers.

All each asks is that you stay sincere.



Their pointing out problems

Without trying to solve them

Begs you to uninvolve them.



Being able to spot problems

Doesn't actually solve them.

Time to get involved then?



So you see a problem?

So easy to solve then?

So you'll do so when?



It's not a crisis, it's but a chance

To take an even stronger stance

Alongside others who advance.



When you're headed somewhere bright,

Eager passengers will form long lines.

No, everyone's vehicle is deep inside.



Notice closely: Have you been heard?

Beyond the details conveyed by words,

Has an exchange of feelings occurred?



You can tend to give, and give, and give,

Forgetting what you truly need to live -

To both give - and receive - to the brim.



Sorry to disappoint: It was a trick.

Some people are simply good at it -

So don't let your response be quick.



Many offers are simply a ruse

Perhaps not intended to abuse,

But ones to rightfully refuse.



Many offers are actually a ruse

To influence, mislead, and use

More time than you'd choose.



Stay focused. Don't be distracted

By anyone demanding a reaction.

Your sincerity is gaining traction.



Bit by bit, you make your way there.

Progress visits when you're unaware,

Too focused to notice you're so rare.



What they're wanting from your abilities

Has experienced a sudden unavailability,

But for those who share heart symmetry.



Your generosity must also close the gate

Behind itself, since thieves lay in wait,

In search of unguarded time to waste.



All you have is time

Of one certain kind:

Of your own design.



You may feel they're taking advantage,

But in truth, you had dusty standards.

It's something you can easily handle.



Where you lack standards, they'll poke,

Claiming their attempts are but jokes.

May your sharpest clarity be invoked.



A job well begun is already half done,

So if you can, let preparation be fun,

With a process that's second to none.



As the only one who can waste your time,

You're accountable to discern and decide

Between what's fleeting and what's wise.



If you go and do that, the asks won't end.

Using more of your time than you intend

Is how to disregard rather than befriend.



Fantastic ideas love to come

When you're busy having fun

Getting enjoyable things done.



Some things don't deserve a response.

Just because it's what someone wants,

You don't have to answer every knock.



Collaboration has the best of all worlds.

It's almost magical how much it unfurls:

Keep focus on the overlapping concerns.



Whether their plea is soft or solemn,

What they didn't plan for is on them;

It's neither your project nor problem.



Express your point as plainly as you can,

Without worrying who will understand.

You just need to let inspiration land.



Take your time, most especially about this:

Make sure what you're thinking about fits.

Nothing's worse than misdirection of wits.



Emotion can spark a reaction that's off,

Which spirals into others just because.

Raise your state, with your heart aloft.



When your state of mind feels off,

Check where your heart's feels soft;

Where it doesn't is the likely cause.



When events bear down with some weight,

Take control of your own emotional state.

Your strength is nothing to entrust to fate.



Stability is nothing to leave to fate.

Forget about the distractions: Wait

Out lesser thoughts, hold the greats.



The moment they dare to offend,

It won't go the way they attempt

The moment virtue is your intent.



The moment virtue is your intent,

Who could possibly come offend?

Release drama. Embrace strength.



Your situation may not feel neat.

Nonetheless, you are complete -

As the driver (and not backseat).



Congratulations! You're already complete!

With fresh opportunities, you are replete.

And your potential has already increased.



Pondering doom

Emits toxic fumes:

Pick better fuel.



It stinks to be confused,

So scrub it away as soon

As clarity showers you.



Thoughts of doom

Have very little use,

So cut them loose.



Thoughts are some amazing tools,

Most effective when wisely used,

Least, when borrowed or brand new.



The option to react is yours.

Either do as you did before,

Or do what always endures.



Kudos, but don't get too excited

Lest your focus become divided

Between diligent and delighted.



Some opportunities need to be released

Not because of anywhere that they lead,

But because of how much time you need.



Of the thoughts you think that you think,

How many are to other people's linked?

Let ones that don't give you wings sink.



Thoughts are like clouds, each one distinct,

Each one moving on its own, rarely in sync;

You are the rarer place where they can link.



They're just thoughts - no need to act.

They're the furthest things from fact.

They're drifting - not riding a track.



You entertain thoughts, but host ideas,

Then give goals a home for many years.

How long will you let that one stay here?



The order determines the outcome.

So if you want to get all this done,

Check on what's already been begun.



Once you find how all the pieces fit,

Figure out a way to call it what it is

To deal realistically with what exists.



It's where you feel uprooted that you grow.

The seed only works once it's buried below

The beautiful, comfortable place it knows.



You may feel you don't belong here.

While the sentiment may be sincere,

The truth is, your potential is clear.



They're forcing you to raise your standards.

There's no other way for this to be handled.

They'll obey what's decided, not demanded.



If you can, build upon your yesterdays.

It tends to be one of the very best ways

For whatever is most useful to remain.



You won't have much time for that,

So give what you cannot use back,

And tighten any remaining slack.



At the time, they didn't know any better.

You transcend the whole thing, however,

Because you've been out in the weather.



For what it's worth, they knew no better.

Based on now, neither did you. However,

You're the resilient one, come whatever.



Don't strive to think even bigger thoughts.

Don't try to feel how you think you ought.

Try to get all your trying to grind to a halt.



Keep as much as you can to a single channel,

One central place you can reasonably handle

The incoming flow and set some standards.



Don't let that emotion make the choice,

But pay very close attention to its voice,

Even if the mind pretends to be annoyed.



Don't speed up to keep pace with them,

Nor slow down - it's the same problem.

Yesterday's you is who you race against.



You're so close: Keep going,

For without even knowing,

Your brightness is growing.



If you get a wish, make it for stamina

So that you're easily able to handle a

Challenge of even greater diameter.



Channel the strength of an animal, 

Along with its unbridled stamina;

You'll be this obstacle's damager.



They don't have to catch up to you

Or measure up alongside to prove

They have talents to contribute.



No, you didn't deserve any of that.

And yet it happened, matter-of-fact.

Yes to bouncing forward - not back.



What you do shapes who you'll become,

So try to make that doing as much fun

As you possibly can before being done.



What you do shapes who you'll become,

So focus far less on finally getting done

Than introducing yourself to everyone.



It's as serious as you make it,

Even if you're truly mistaken,

So have sense, and maintain it.



Little else can be said

Till the point is dead:

What do you intend?



From yourself, there is no escape.

So rather than leaving this to fate,

Go to where the swirl originates.



Don't let their weakness amplify yours.

Do better than you've ever done before:

Depend on your strengths all the more.



Learn how to best spend time in life.

Stop paying minutes of hours to strife

To invest more days in feeling bright.



Who you spend your time with

Becomes the great determinant

Of what becomes permanent.



Before your patience can break,

Decide how much you'll tolerate,

Then warn them what's at stake.



Acknowledge what you're thinking about.

Then you'll control which feelings sprout;

Watering hope drowns the seeds of doubt.



Plans got you going, but didn't lead here.

This is the result of your staying sincere

Whether or not the way itself was clear.



Imagine yourself in a better place,

With yesterday's weaknesses erased,

Feeling at peace, in effortless grace.



What are you working toward?

Who is it you are working for?

When will you be your reward?



Do one thing well, or many poorly.

While this truth turns some surly,

You can use it to focus more purely.



Whether off your chest or out your head,

To consciously or unconsciously express,

Gets to work creating what happens next.



Be aware of everything you express

Because of its power over the next

Thought beckoned into your head.



Everything you do and express

Exerts influence over the next

Experiences that await ahead.



Beware those ready excuses -

All their convenient misuses:

Only your trying produces.



Unfortunately, you must beware

With whom you decide to share

(What you say acts like a prayer).



The moment you deem it unexplainable,

Move on to things that feel attainable -

Make yourself that much more capable.



Most of what you do won't be used

To move things forward, it is true.

Therefore keep on sifting through.



Eight of them are as relevant as chatter

(Two out of the ten genuinely matter);

How do you get the majority to scatter?



How then do you focus on the right things

Despite the irrelevant options they bring?

Which parts of the day should you rethink?



Where they're begging you to focus is wrong;

It leads away from where you've been strong.

It would be unwise for you to follow along.



It will be wise to keep your focus sharp.

When you do, beyond dim from dark, the

Contrast between better and best is stark.



Give your strengths far more attention

Than where you feel more disconnected:

You grow what you most often mention.



How much time have you wasted on that?

Well then, it's time to give yourself back

Every minute in a manner that's compact.



Don't just declare that's so - find out.

Assumptions are not what life's about.

Digging is what moves things around.



If it feels convenient, beware.

Growth tends to happen where

Discomfort offers you a dare.



Never let your talents get comfortable

(Inflexibility soon turns insufferable).

Take your work where it's vulnerable.



The moment it becomes overly complex,

Overexplanation naturally happens next.

The simple, durable bridge works best.



You can neither prevent nor compel,

Nor change them by what you tell -

All you can do is live openly well.



Which parts do you want to change?

To do that, what else must remain?

What if nothing can stay the same?



You don't have to settle for that.

Hearts expand as well as contract:

So, get what matters most back.



Your instinct is right - to refuse to settle -

Especially amongst those prone to meddle

While you're doing something so special.



You do not have to settle for this,

Not even as a small part in the mix.

You will feel when it's the best fit.



Settling is a worthless endeavor.

Awaiting is a far better mentor -

More suited to you, altogether.



Around critics, let your work speak

(Don't let out so much as a squeak):

Wasting energy will make you weak.



Conserve your energy amidst critics

Who've honed the art of the nitpick.

Your work prefers all you can give it.



What's one gift you can give yourself

That would increase today's health?

Then get that done - and very well.



There is some form of support you need,

That's impossible for others to perceive,

Yet abundant the moment you proceed.



Finish this part of it first.

Put in the thankless work

(Impatience may be hurt).



Go forward, no matter the resistance

Because there is a world of difference

Knowing, versus going, the distance.



The problem is, that's just hearsay.

At best, it may not lead you astray.

At worst, it may trick you to stay.



Just a little further, if you're able.

If not, focus on finding your stable.

Either way, it's effort that enables.



Habits are the roots for your results.

Each day serves as a part of the trunk.

Keep branching out and growing up.



At some point, there will be no more

Challenges or opportunities in store.

Until then, leave closed those doors.



The only thing that makes certain

Is what you're doing is working,

So press on, even if it's hurting.



It's alright to admit that was enough.

No need for excuses or any such stuff

(No need to do what you don't love).



It has to be to your liking,

Or else, why begin trying?

You deserve some exciting.



It doesn't have to be to your liking

For you to simply continue trying.

The boring points out the exciting.



The days are long, but the years are short,

So don't search too far for proper support.

You're surrounded by every possible sort.



Right where you don't feel support,

You have guidance of a different sort

That will help discern - not distort.



If it's so important to you, begin.

If there's that much at stake, win.

If you're stuck outside, go within.



It would take so little to break through

That it's something you may as well do;

Know you will be one among very few.



Whatever doesn't occur to you to handle

Will get addressed via raising standards,

Which limits which wishes get granted.



Health is your most prized possession -

One you cannot add to any collection -

But keep on making daily investments.



Who can say what's coming?

So just do what you're loving;

What makes you feel bubbly?



What's inside that you need to let out?

What's all this holding been all about?

Have you a sense of the entire amount?



The thing you need to do is answer for you:

Not what, when, where, or how - but who -

Who are you finally willing to introduce?



They're kind to offer, but do not accept.

It's not time to have outside helpers yet;

Distraction becomes the kindest threat.



Try it out - share it with a trusted few.

That's the wisest thing you can now do

To ease your way into rigorous review.



They couldn't know how much it meant,

How much time and energy you've spent;

Your reward comes from what you dreamt.



Who can say for sure

Whether it's secure?

Does it have allure?



You want them to be excited, but why?

How they feel won't make things fly.

Draw power from the fact that you try.



Before bouncing into action like a spring,

Before you go and divulge the whole thing,

Ask yourself about the benefits they bring.



What is their actual offer - not finessed?

How much is meant - not just expressed?

Could you offer their intentions a test?



They'll keep testing your standards

To make sure you're able to handle

Turning preferences into demands.



Offer what you can, but be flexible

To make your offering accessible -

Within the range of what's sensible.



Tempted? Wait as your senses come back.

There's no good reason for you to do that.

The best of all options awaits you in fact.



No, you haven't been double-crossed.

Sometimes your timing is simply off.

Remind your feelings who's the boss.



No, there's no sprawling conspiracy,

So get back to work - more cheerily.

Be proud of your level of coherency.



You will recover and then some,

Provided you make it more fun

By trying to include everyone.



Not that you should move quicker,

But maybe it's an offer to consider.

The question is: Can they deliver?



They're serving as a reflection of you.

That's the reason you feel so renewed.

Their resonance is raising your mood.



Balance forward momentum with present care,

Otherwise, of crises you'll have to beware.

Upkeep wards off every unexpected scare.



There is a balance to mind

As you continue to climb,

Easiest kept taking time.



Can you believe you're this close?

Is is thanks to what you did most,

Or bad habits you refused to host?



If you simply wait a little bit longer,

Your hold will be that much stronger.

Your potential will be your launcher.



Patience. Things will soon improve,

But not on a timeline you can move.

Find your own deep patience groove.



Today is going to feel a little bit better.

You will notice, like changing weather,

Clouds of emotion will not stay forever.



Abundance and connection have a bond.

When your care is both deep and strong,

Rewards will chase after you, lifelong.



Spending more time with fewer inputs

Helps separate treasures from trinkets,

Because wealth awaits in the minutes.



Beware your own assumptions.

What they need: Interruption

And complete deconstruction.



The issue lies with your assumptions.

Whatever was their former function,

All they now offer you is obstruction.



First, get rid of those assumptions

That block free thought's function.

Next, get on with your production.



Oh, those outdated assumptions

That masquerade as instruction.

Unmask each you can summon.



That's no more than an assumption

That's now more of a malfunction:

Thoroughly undo the obstruction.



An assumption will snowball into more.

Prevent an avalanche. Carefully explore

Each summit, even ones you've ignored.



Do you understand whatever's happening?

Don't bother. Delve deeper by imagining.

Dreams are what deserve your fashioning.



Think about it briefly: It's not news.

Its only purpose is to light your fuse.

There'll be nothing in it you can use.



A victory for them means nothing for you.

After congratulating them, then continue.

A great moment awaits in your own venue.



Do not mistake destruction for building.

Though they may be unable, yet willing,

You deserve outcomes that are fulfilling.



Of course, what you dismiss as ridiculous

Was the same reason they made such a fuss.

So don't be too concerned, but be curious.



You were wise to remain unfazed.

Until their offering is rephrased,

Why even pretend to be amazed?



They are allowed to wonder and even to ask.

But a ripe and ready answer is not your task.

In preexisting completeness is where to bask.



What seems foolish, may very well be.

Trust your instinct, then necessarily,

What unravels will do so effortlessly.



To catch untruths, tiny or great,

Be discerning, or else just wait.

Either way, use time as your bait.



True, that may be too meticulous.

You may think, "How ridiculous!"

But aren't you a little bit curious?



Hopefully, their way works for them.

Hopefully, they won't ask you again.

Thankfully, you determine the end.



Their way barely worked for them -

It's from there that chaos stemmed.

So don't help grow that back again.



Sometimes it's hard to refuse.

But it's what you've got to do

To get yourself unconfused.



Which option is more of an investment?

In the moment, do a quick assessment:

Which offers the deeper contentment?



By their feedback, how much meets enough?

Would soundly reasonable effort measure up?

Is deciding to cease seeking to please tough?



What works best for you?

Fewer gaps? More room?

Right now? Very soon?



It doesn't have to feel like a struggle.

There might even be a way to chuckle

About the real root of all the trouble.



Keep moving, regardless of the action.

Momentum gives your purpose traction,

And keeps circulating inner satisfaction.



You're increasing your level of stamina

Being your own most honest examiner:

Insights are clearest when unanimous.



You know what you consider good enough.

You know the personal outcomes you love.

You know how to go beyond measuring up.



Unfortunately, you can only do so much

Before it makes more sense to give up -

Or give all that "makes more sense" up.



Spend more time with fewer of them

And notice the meaning return again:

It's upon hours that moments depend.



Trust none who like you superficially.

Trust those who love you, to one degree.

Trust most those who live love deliberately.



Are they loving themselves as you wish to

Love your own self, through and through?

Whatever you notice becomes easier to do.



What proof of life does self-love leave?

First, it gets you to tend to your needs.

Utmost, it accepts every way you feel.



Meeting someone who loves themselves

In a heathy way, you treat yourself well.

In some way, your associations foretell.



Don't go that way - it loops back here.

Take the way where turns are unclear,

Shaped more by intentions than years.



Don't interpret it that way. Find another.

Even if true, some thoughts slowly smother

The thoughts that help you benefit others.



And if that were true, then what?

That's merely the shell of the nut.

Think thoughts that crack or cut.



Express what you actually mean -

Leave the vague space in between

Let your ideas be heard and seen.



Once you're en route, goals change

To where the former seem strange:

Continue to consciously rearrange.



Wherever your thoughts gravitate,

Contradictory ones might irritate -

Nothing rethinking can't alleviate.



Strong opinions end up being used

In a way that may work against you,

So strengthen balance as your truth.



You only get so many thoughts today.

Don't let the wrongs ones proliferate.

Better to have fewer that help create.



You may not comprehend what you've done,

But this is a next chapter that you've begun

In which your self-love is second to none.



Connection is what will make it worthwhile.

Regardless of whether they match your style,

Share stories from this life you've compiled.



Think less broadly. Love more deeply.

Strive less mentally. Try more sweetly.

Become yourself again, less discreetly.



What happens is you get mesmerized

By the repeating pattern in disguise.

So take your own routine by surprise.



Foolish is as foolish does.

Don't redo it just because.

Let it be a habit that was.



Less coming in means less to process,

Which means less likelihood to guess

Rather than simply await what's next.



Limit how much you take in just yet

And a simpler perspective you'll get

On which things require a full reset.



The last thing you need at this point

Is to get your priorities out of joint.

Cut through the background noise.



It's going to be so much easier soon.

From strife, you're growing immune.

Now goodness has become opportune.



What awaits will amaze you yet,

Less from everything you'll get,

More from the standard it'll set.



Don't linger. Head where it's lightest.

Turn from the corners of uptightness.

Keep your attention on the brightest.



Remember: You don't want that anymore.

So just as you would treat a locked door,

Briefly think on what you locked it for.



Be glad that they've begun moving on.

It means they're also becoming strong

Enough to never again string you along.



Hold out hope for all to move on,

For everyone to finally get along,

For bonds to be lastingly strong.



That might not be enough for them.

Yes, they'll probably complain again.

No, there's nothing for you to defend.



They're coming to complain again.

You'll wield no control over when.

However, you can refuse to attend.



This choice is the essence of enough -

This is the one that sums them all up:

This moment is yours to like or love.
